{"prompt": "Hey", "completion": "So name, we don't know each other very well."} 
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "So I want you to know any time if you want to ask me anything about me, you can."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "You don't have to, though."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "OK? But I'm going to ask you quite a few questions."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "About you."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "And a little bit about your family."} 
{"prompt": "All right.", "completion": "And one of the things that I like to do to help me get to know you a little bit better is to draw a family tree. And so I'm going to do that now."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "And I know a little bit about your family. And so I'm going to start here. This is going to be your dad, OK? He's going to be big square. I'm going to go over here, and then your mom is going to be a big circle. And are you the oldest?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "All right. And you're going to be square. And so we put it here. And how old are you?"} 
{"prompt": "10.", "completion": "10. And then you have a brother, right?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And how old is he?"} 
{"prompt": "Seven.", "completion": "He's seven. And what's his name?"} 
{"prompt": "Carter.", "completion": "Carter. And your mom's name?"} 
{"prompt": "Sara.", "completion": "Sara with no H, right?"} 
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "How old is she?"} 
{"prompt": "42 I think.", "completion": "42 you think?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "I'll put a question mark there because we're not sure."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "And then your dad's name?"} 
{"prompt": "Dave.", "completion": "Dave. And how old is your dad?"} 
{"prompt": "I think 45.", "completion": "OK. But we'll put a question mark there, because we're not exactly sure. OK. And that's it? Anybody else live in your house?"} 
{"prompt": "Pets.", "completion": "Oh, you have some pets?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "What do you have?"} 
{"prompt": "Two rabbits and a frog.", "completion": "Whoa. I don't know if I can make very good rabbits, but here's a rabbit. Here's another rabbit. And I know I can't make a good frog, but-it sounds like you have a lot of things that jump."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "What are the rabbits' names?"} 
{"prompt": "Rex and Scaper.", "completion": "Rex and Scaper."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And the frog?"} 
{"prompt": "I don't know his name. My brother never told me.", "completion": "It's your brother's frog."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah, and he never told me its name, so.", "completion": "Mmm. OK."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. He doesn't really tell anybody it's name.", "completion": "All right. So that's really who hangs out in your house, for the most part."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And then if you go up, do you have some grandparents, too?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "So on your dad's side."} 
{"prompt": "His mom's name is Donna.", "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "And I don't know his dad's name, because I never met him, so. And then on my mom's side, my grandma's, which is Kay, um, and then my grandpa's name's Manny.", "completion": "Manny?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "OK. And so if you were to see this whole scene-and do you have, ah, you probably have some cousins, too, don't you?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "It's going to complicated. So where do we start?"} 
{"prompt": "I don't-", "completion": "Your mom has- A brother and a sister. Is that right?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "OK. So, older or younger than her? Do you know?"} 
{"prompt": "They're both younger.", "completion": "So they-that's it. So you have those two. We'll say one is a boy and one's a girl, or?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Yeah. And then they have kids?"} 
{"prompt": "My aunt doesn't, but my uncle does.", "completion": "How many kids?"} 
{"prompt": "Two.", "completion": "So he's got two kids. And how old are they?"} 
{"prompt": "Three and one.", "completion": "Ah. So they're pretty young."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Boy, girl?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "One of each?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "OK. So three and one. And then on this side?"} 
{"prompt": "So my dad-I think he has two siblings with children, and mmm-actually, all three of his siblings have children. So one has two teenagers who are like 15 and 17.", "completion": "OK. So there's one that's 15 and one that's 17."} 
{"prompt": "And then his other sister has but one, kid that's nine, I think. Yeah, nine.", "completion": "[UNINTELLIGIBLE]. Is that a boy or a girl?"} 
{"prompt": "Boy.", "completion": "OK. So, nine."} 
{"prompt": "And, then another one has, one boy who, I think he's around five.", "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "So, yeah.", "completion": "So you've got two teenage cousins, a nine-year-old cousin, a five-year-old cousin, a three-year-old cousin, and a one-year-old cousin."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "OK. Out of all these people, including your aunts and uncles, cousins, grandparents, parents, and brother, who would you say you're closest to? Who do you hang out with the most?"} 
{"prompt": "Well if you call fighting hanging out, my brother.", "completion": " So you guys fight a little bit? We'll put a little squiggly line here, kind of meaning that sometimes you guys fight."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Probably my mom or dad.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. So both. You're pretty close to your mom, you're pretty close to your dad."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "OK. And then would you say-I was going to ask what do you fight with the most."} 
{"prompt": " My brother, for sure.", "completion": "Yeah. So that's-we'll put a little fighting there. And then who would you say is-who do you think is the best athlete? Who's the best sporty person in all of these people?"} 
{"prompt": "Either me or one of my cousins-one of the teenage cousins.", "completion": "So you're pretty sporty, and maybe somebody over here, too."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Who is the best at music?"} 
{"prompt": " I don't know.", "completion": "You don't know. Who's the best at art and like, drawing, and artsy things."} 
{"prompt": "Probably Donna.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. So she's kind of artsy."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "I can put that down-artsy. Who's the most angry?"} 
{"prompt": "Like who's mad a lot?", "completion": "Yeah. Who gets mad a lot?"} 
{"prompt": "My brother.", "completion": "You think your brother gets mad a lot."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. For sure.", "completion": "Who gets in trouble the most?"} 
{"prompt": "My brother. Yeah.", "completion": "No doubt about it."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "OK. If you had three words that you could use to describe your dad, what words would you use?"} 
{"prompt": "Gone.", "completion": "Gone?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah, like he's left town. Busy. And, I don't know really the third one.", "completion": "That's OK. We've got two-gone and busy."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And three words to describe your mom."} 
{"prompt": "School.", "completion": "What was that?"} 
{"prompt": "She's in school a lot.", "completion": "School. She's in school. I thought you said screwl. [LAUGHTER]"} 
{"prompt": "She's also busy with homework.", "completion": "So she's busy."} 
{"prompt": "And I'd say that she's kind of slow at times, like sometimes it takes her a while to figure something out.", "completion": "So she's a little slow."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "It takes her a while to figure things out. Now, how about your brother-three words to describe your brother."} 
{"prompt": "Noisy.", "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "Tattletales.", "completion": "Tattletale."} 
{"prompt": "Likes baseball. He likes baseball.", "completion": "OK. OK. And then the hardest one of all-three words to"} {"describe prompt".""} 
{"prompt": "I like football and hockey, and, I enjoy eating.", "completion": "You really like to eat, huh?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "I should have brought some snacks."} 
{"prompt":"", "completion": "What's your favorite thing to have for a snack, like? What do you like to eat? Just everything?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. I don't get a lot of very, like, sugary food, because my mom doesn't really ever buy it. But, yeah.", "completion": "Yeah. Can't think of a favorite right now?"} 
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "So now, if you were to say, well, what are the-you know like your parents try to teach you things. What would you say are the lessons that they try to teach you? What do they try to teach you? What are their family values, the things that they believe in?"} 
{"prompt": "Probably not being allowed at other people's houses, like when their parents are trying to do something, or, yeah. And just like, polite, I guess.", "completion": "Be polite."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "So like, don't bug other people in their houses when they don't want you."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And be polite."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "OK. Anything else that your parents really believe in?"} 
{"prompt": "Not off the top of my head.", "completion": "OK. Those are the main ones. If you think of some later, that's fine. So one thing I just think of when I see all this is that other than Taylor, you're kind of the-I mean, I guess your brother is kind of close to your age. But you're the only one who's 10 right now."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And, in fact, nobody's really very close. And Taylor, though, he's close to you, but he lives in Great Falls."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Do you and Taylor get along OK?"} 
{"prompt": "I-he's only a couple months younger than me.", "completion": "Ah, so you guys play together OK?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And get along. And it sounds like you and your brother are close, but you have some-"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "-tension sometimes."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Yeah. Because he's noisy and he's a tattletale and he's mad a lot."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "He's in trouble a lot. Whew. That's a lot of pressure for an older brother to have-"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "-a younger brother like that."} 
{"prompt": "And I have to babysit him sometimes.", "completion": "Really?"} 
{"prompt": "And my cousins, who are three and one, so.", "completion": "How does that go?"} 
{"prompt": "Not so well.", "completion": "Really? What usually happens?"} 
{"prompt": "Just a lot of stress, because they all have a lot of energy.", "completion": "Mmm."} 
{"prompt": "And, yeah.", "completion": "That's a big responsibility."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. And then you, with-especially, I mean, a one- year-old, I suppose, although the one-year-old's maybe talking?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "She can't even talk, so that makes it even harder.", "completion": "So she's probably really hard to keep track of, and then the three-year-old's probably-"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And then your brother. Whew."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. You have a lot. I mean, and you like to play football and hockey and eat."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And I'll bet you having a little brother and little cousins kind of interferes with that sometimes."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Yeah. Have you ever been a bad mood?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": " Have you?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "What do people do when you're in a bad, or what do you when you're in a bad mood? What do you look like? What do you act like?"} 
{"prompt": "Not so well.", "completion": "No?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Like what? If I was watching, would I see-would you like be stomping around, would you-"} 
{"prompt": "I'd probably be yelling.", "completion": "Yelling."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Like what? What do you yell?"} 
{"prompt": "It depends on what I'm mad about.", "completion": "Do you yell at your brother?"} 
{"prompt": "Well it kind of depends on what I'm mad about. Like, if it's him, I'd yell at him, but sometimes, a lot of the time, it's my mom or brother, because, you know.", "completion": "So you might be-if I were watching you and you were in a bad mood, I might see you yelling at your mom or yelling at your brother."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Or just yelling about something that you're mad about."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. And not normally my dad, because he's usually out of town.", "completion": "Ah. He's out of town a lot, so you don't yell at him."} 
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "He's not around."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Yeah. Does that make it harder, too, I guess to be the oldest person-the oldest kid the family and then your dad's not even home?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "What's that like?"} 
{"prompt": "Kind of hard, because my brother, he-he brags, like he thinks he's just as good as-like he acts like just like an 11-year-old, and like all his friends are really kind of annoying.  And, yeah. He's just-gets on my nerves about 90% of the time. So.", "completion": "Yeah. So I'll be he likes two things. I bet he likes your attention, and as much of it as he can get. Kind I'll bet the other thing he likes it to get you in trouble."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. He likes that a lot.", "completion": "Yeah. So, that's tricky. So I have some ideas of what might work."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "Because I'm betting that the same old thing all the time is going to stop working."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "So do you know-there's a famous guy who worked a lot with rats. Now, I don't want to say that your brother's a rat."} 
{"prompt": "He acts like one.", "completion": " But do you know what the famous guy thought?"} 
{"prompt": "What?", "completion": "That punishment-you know what punishment is?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Yeah? That's like if you do something I don't like-right? Let's say you're messing up your hair, and I go knock it off. Stop it."} 
{"prompt":"", "completion": "Stop it. Stop messing up your hair. Stop it. So what do you want to do?"} 
{"prompt": "Keep doing it.", "completion": "Yeah. A lot of times-what he said was that punishment, when you punish someone, it just doesn't work very well, because usually- hold out your hand. If I push you, what do you want to do?"} 
{"prompt": "Push you back.", "completion": "You want to push back, right? And pretty soon, we're just pushing, and I'm saying, stop that! And you're saying, I'll do it if I want to. Right?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. "} 
{"prompt": "And I'd know where I'd get the money.", "completion": " That's true. It's probably pretty expensive to send a seven- year-old to a hot place in Africa."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah, at least if I would have to pay for a round trip.", "completion": " That's right."} 
{"prompt": "So.", "completion": "I can't help but wonder, though, if thinking your brother is annoying-if that's helpful or not helpful."} 
{"prompt": " I don't know.", "completion": "Because I wonder if you think he's annoying if that makes him more annoying."} 
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "I don't know either. That's just a test. I wonder about if you were to start thinking that, boy, my brother is so nice-that would never work."} 
{"prompt": "Nuh uh.", "completion": "No? It's impossible."} 
{"prompt": "Probably.", "completion": "Yeah.", "completion": "Ah, brothers. They are tough."} 
{"prompt": "Yes, very.", "completion": "Do you ever play any games? I'm going to do one with you now, even though it's going to get us out of the camera a little bit. But I have this game that I play sometimes."} 
{"prompt": "Mmm, OK.", "completion": "You ready? OK. So we're going to try to stand up. We're going to stand up. OK. And then, yeah, you should stand just like that, and put your toes toward my toes. Stand up pretty straight. So this is called the hand-pushing game. You ever done it?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Have you? Well, you don't just touch my hands. You stay like this, OK? And then you go like that, and then whoever loses his balance first, loses."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "OK? You ready? All right. Are you ready?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt":"", "completion": "You're pretty good. I usually win by now."} 
{"prompt": " I'm kind of using the chair.", "completion": "Oh, you are? Uh oh."} 
{"prompt": "[UNINTELLIGIBLE].", "completion": "Stand away. Stand back."} 
{"prompt": "Hold on.", "completion": "Uh oh. All right. You're all right."} 
{"prompt": "[UNINTELLIGIBLE].", "completion": "Now, OK. Now I can win."} 
{"prompt":"", "completion": "Ah, did you move your foot?"} 
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Yes. I got you. OK. You ready? Round two? Oh. That's-I forgot to tell you-one rule is you can't hit people in the chest or anything. OK. So now you know that. Because I mean, I could go like that and just push you."} 
{"prompt":"", "completion": "Ugh! Ugh! Whoops. You OK?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Yeah. Ooh. All right. That's two. One more?"} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "OK. This is a little bit like your brother, right?"} 
{"prompt": "A tiny bit.", "completion": "How is it like him?"} 
{"prompt": "Probably the shoving. Oh, oh.", "completion": " Ah. I guess I'm the champion."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "So how do you think I won?"} 
{"prompt": "Because you're bigger.", "completion": "Ah. That does help."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "When you weigh more."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And so that's why probably whenever you try to go up against your dad or your mom, you kinda lose."} 
{"prompt": "If my mom's tried to, move my arm in certain directions, she can't do it, but other than that, she can get me.", "completion": "Can she?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Yeah. So you know what I like to-you know the trick of the game? So stick your hands out so we can do this sitting down. So you can almost always win-and if you do with your brother, I guarantee you you will win. OK?"} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "Do you know why? But not just because of size, but because of-do you know what the word strategy means?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Yeah. It's like if you were playing football or you were playing hockey, and you fake somebody out. Have you done that before?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "You know, you act like you're going one direction, then you go the other direction-fake 'em out. So here's the deal. One of the things that makes brothers annoying is a thing called revenge. You know what revenge is?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "So if you do this, OK? You start the game. You say, hey, Carter, do you want to play a game I learned? OK. And then you go like this, go, really fast. Like, slap him in the hands. And you know what he's going to want to do?"} 
{"prompt": "Get me back.", "completion": "Exactly. And so then what do you do?"} 
{"prompt": "Dodge it.", "completion": "Just dodge it and he falls over, just like you did that one time, right."} 
{"prompt":"", "completion": "And so it's sort of a trick. And that's exactly, I think, what's going on with you and Carter, is it he annoys you. Right? He goes like this. Is that annoying? Huh?"} 
{"prompt": "Kind of.", "completion": "Am I being annoying?"} 
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "And then what do you?"} 
{"prompt": "Get him back.", "completion": "Yes. You want to get him back. But he-the problem is he want you to get him back, because you are-"} 
{"prompt": "Bigger.", "completion": "No."} 
{"prompt": "Older.", "completion": "Sort of.
