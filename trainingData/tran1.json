{"prompt": "I'm dealing with issues of humiliation.", "completion": "So just start with the thought of your face blushing-maybe an image of it in your mind-and then just say whatever comes to mind."} 
{"prompt": "Gosh. The words, I feel like, sound so harsh, but really I think of embarrassment, humiliation. I feel like I look stupid. Um, I- yeah. Those kinds of things.", "completion": "Yeah. Pretty harsh things."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "If you go back in time, starting now, but just go way back, as early as you can, can you think of humiliation, embarrassment experiences where you maybe first started having that kind of flushing?"} 
{"prompt": "You know, it probably was when I was in college. And there were people that would say oh my gosh, your face just turned red. And I actually had someone that I worked with that would say to me, oh, I just love to embarrass you and watch your face turn red. And I can remember that I hadn't been that aware of it, but then there was just something that-it just started, you know, the awareness, I think. It just started happening more and more often.", "completion": "Yeah. Back in college-it was an early time when you remember it."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Can you remember a particular time when you flushed and what was going on then?"} 
{"prompt": "When I was in high school and the teacher would ask a question, I would feel fine answering a question and speaking up. And when I got to college, I wouldn't because I was afraid my face would turn red.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "So it's just that, that I would be in class and I would feel like I had something to contribute, but I didn't want to talk because I thought I would draw attention to myself with my face turning red, yeah.", "completion": "What might you have said that would make your face turn red?"} 
{"prompt": "I don't know. I wasn't really worried about the content, but I think that just talking in the group, it's just, I-I knew it would turn red, and the idea of it turning red, and people thinking, gosh, look how insecure she is that she can't even talk without her face turning red. I just didn't want to deal with it, so I sort of quit talking in class. Yeah.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. And so we started with what causes the flushing or the bushing. And it seemed like that was related to some things in college and people bringing that to your attention. And as you focused on it more and more, it seems to have gotten less and less in control. Would that be right?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Yeah.", "completion": "And so now we've moved to talking about some safety concerns about your children mostly, but just tragedy striking you."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And again, it seems like, maybe in some ways, the more and more you try to control your worry thoughts, the less they feel in control. It kind of feels like they keep getting bigger and bigger. Is that-"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. They do. And I-you know, I have periods of time where I don't feel this way, but-but, yeah. I have a lot of thoughts of just wanting to live like a normal person and not having all these thoughts all the time in my head. And I wonder, as we're talking now, if I just kind of am living a little anxiously all the time, and that's maybe affecting my-I don't know. I mean, that's what it feels like right now.", "completion": "Yeah, it kind of sends along your anxiety. Something might go wrong."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Something bad might happen."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Something that could be a tragedy. And the first thing you think of is the car accident sort of thing, and what else? What other kinds of tragedies or just even small bad things might happen?"} 
{"prompt": "I don't-I don't worry about small things, honestly. I mean, I don't. I feel like I'm pretty good about that. I don't want-yeah. I can categorize things. Like, OK. With when my kids my kids play really rough a lot, and I think, well, that would just be a broken limb. So we can-that-go ahead.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "But when it starts to be, well, that could be a big head injury, then-you know? And I think of all that. I mean, I go through the whole checklist in my head a lot. And I don't feel like, do other people do that? I mean, I don't know. I'm always questioning. Like, is this crazy to be just constantly having this in my head? And I think it to my kids that I hope that I appear completely calm.  That's how I want to appear, because I don't want to put this on them, but.", "completion": "You'd like to have it in your head less-whether other people are crazy or whether it's crazy or not, you'd like to have it in your head less."} 
{"prompt": "For sure. For sure. Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Yeah. And what kinds of things have you tried?"} 
{"prompt": "Well, I always think about whenever I'm challenged with something, I always think about the worst-case scenario. And I believe completely that I can handle anything-anything, and I've gone through this whole list. Like if I lost my limbs or whatever,  I could handle anything. But I can't handle something happening to my kids.", "completion": "Uh huh."} 
{"prompt": "And that-I just-so when I try to approach this logically and think, well, so-and-so has made it through life without a big thing happening, and so-and-so-I mean, people just have a lot of tragedy. And so I just come back to that, and-", "completion": "And feel that underlying nervousness."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Yeah. Yeah. And yet, if we go back to the blushing, that's not a bad thing happening. Speaking up in class? Not a bad thing happening. And yet that feels kind of out of control, too."} 
{"prompt": "It does, because I really hate to be perceived as stupid.", "completion": "Mmm."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. And that's kind of a thing that goes way back for me too. When I was younger, I had this persona that developed that I was an airhead, and I've had to work so hard to kind of-because I think I used it for a while to my advantage, and then in college again I had to work so hard to get rid of that whole image. And it still is kind of in there somewhere, I think.", "completion": "You still sort of have some fear of being perceived as an airhead."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Wanting to prove that you, in fact, are not."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And you used the word stupid."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Go with that."} 
{"prompt": "I don't know. I just, I really value intelligence, I guess. I value it a lot in other people. And I, I don't know. I just, I hate that I let myself have that persona for so long. It's just, it really bugs me.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "I feel like I could have done other things with my life if I hadn't gone without it so much.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. What's going on to make that seem like a good thing then?"} 
{"prompt": "Oh, I don't know. I don't know. I mean, people gave me attention and laughed, and I don't know.", "completion": "What kinds of things did you do?"} 
{"prompt": "You know, I said some silly things like-this is in seventh grade. But still when I see these people, they'll bring it up.", "completion": "What did you say in seventh grade?"} 
{"prompt": "Oh gosh, really?", "completion": "Ahh."} 
{"prompt": " There was something about a pen that had a calculator in it, and the battery died on the calc-or the-maybe it had a digital clock in it, and the battery died. And I didn't think the pen would work anymore because the battery died. And, uh, it was just a split moment thing, but everyone laughed and thought it was hilarious. And I think that's kind of when it started. And so people st"}ill, 30 years {later, so, do you have a pen, "prompt"?"", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "And I can laugh. I mean, I am totally fine laughing at myself. That's not the problem. It's just, I just don't want that identity that I'm dumb.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. And you kept it for a while."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Like a long time.", "completion": "Yeah. What are some other examples of-"} 
{"prompt": "Mmm. Really? Another one that comes to mind is someone told me that their aunt had had a miscarriage, and I asked her if the baby was all right.", "completion": "Uh huh."} 
{"prompt": "So, you know? Because I just wasn't-I knew-I don't know what. That was just a dumb thing to say. I didn't mean to say that, and so that's another thing people bring up 30 years later.", "completion": "Uh huh."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And that doesn't sound intentional."} 
{"prompt": "It wasn't.", "completion": "The pen and the miscarriage comment."} 
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "And yet one of the things I kind of hear you saying is, well, that's embarrassing. But it's even maybe more embarrassing that you kind of took on that identity?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Or did you take it on, people put it on you?"} 
{"prompt": "I think people put it on me after that, and then I went with it after that. Those are the two things that I really remember saying that were the worst. And then after that, I just kinda went with it.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. And did you ever intentionally say things that were-"} 
{"prompt": "Oh, probably. I mean, I really don't remember other things, but I probably did act the part for a while, yeah.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt":"It's hard to talk about it.", "completion": "As you talk about it, it seems very-not really unsettling, but just like you kind of-"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. It makes me cringe.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "How about even before seventh grade? Anything where you felt like you were perceived as stupid?"} 
{"prompt": "Nuh uh. No. I was-actually, I was pretty smart.", "completion": "Uh huh."} 
{"prompt": "Really. So, no. It was kind of a middle school thing.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. And somehow you carry on this sort of remnant from middle school that people might see you as stupid. And that carried into college, and even now you feel that the blushing might be related to that-"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "-thought of I'll be caught-maybe I'll be caught looking stupid."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Yup.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. And the theme with your children is maybe I'll be caught unprepared, maybe tragedy will strike because I'm not prepared?"} 
{"prompt": "Well, when you say that, it makes me think that, yeah, what if I-what if I wasn't worried? Would that make the odds go up that something could happen?", "completion": "What if I wasn't worried about tragedy? What if I wasn't worried about being viewed as stupid or unprepared?"} 
{"prompt": "Well, when I'm thinking about the tragedy part, I mean, what if I let that go and I just, it wasn't on my mind all the time? Then maybe that would make the odds of it happening go up.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "I don't know. It sounds ridiculous when I say, but-", "completion": "Yeah, yeah. But you hear this sort of belief in your mind- maybe worrying about the tragedy helps prevent it."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Yep. I think that somehow that's what I think.", "completion": "And that that prevents it, even in the absence of any specific precautions. I mean, is it possible to take the precautions and then-"} 
{"prompt": "Let it go?", "completion": "Let it go?"} 
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "It seems like there are some things that are outside of your control."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Yeah. I don't know. It feels like if I let it go, then what does that mean?", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "What does it mean?"} 
{"prompt": "It just, it feels a little bit like, now am I being careless if I just let it go? And what comes to my head is do I love them less if I just let it go? Which sounds really weird, but-I don't know. It feels scary to let it go, I guess. But I want to let it go.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. It would be nice to let it go."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "But somehow there's a little superstition in your head that, if I let this go, maybe the odds will be worse, and maybe it's a sign that I don't really love them? That worrying about people is a loving thing?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah, I guess so. I have not thought of it like that, but that's sort of how it feels like. Um, yeah. It feels that way.  I mean, it feels so-it sounds so illogical, but that's how it feels right now.", "completion": "But that-that sort of feels-and when you just go with that, that thought if I worry, then it's love. It's a sign of love. Where do your thoughts go about worry?"} 
{"prompt": "Well first, I feel like my love for them is so much more than worry. So I don't equate worry with love.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "But if I were to just let things go, I perceive other people having more normal thought in their head, and if perceive like, just letting my kids get in a car and just go somewhere and let it go-I do. I let them go in cars-I mean, I do. It's just hard for me. And to imagine myself doing it without having the worry in my head, I don't know-it feels careless.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. And what does careless mean?"} 
{"prompt": "Then I feel a little bit-I think of being negligent, and then I think, and that's when it'll happen.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. Carelessness is negligence. Just keep talking about-just talk your thoughts, even as we sit here, whatever comes."} 
{"prompt": "I just feel like I'm in this, I'm stuck. Like I want to stop worrying. I want to live, and not live with all this fear.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "But I feel like I'm bound to it. And I'm just stuck all the time.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "And I want to be able to think about other things, and not be thinking about what kind of car my friend's mom drives, and is she going to text or talk on the phone while she's driving my kid, and what about the other person, and my husband, and-you know. And, I mean, crazy things. Like I sometimes will, without anyone knowing it-because I think I read that being on the left is more dangerous. So I'll switch and make sure they evenly ride on the left and right, and if I put one of them on a safer side, does that mean I love him-I mean, the thoughts are crazy.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. It's embarrassing when I hear myself even have these thoughts out loud.", "completion": "It kind of makes you blush."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah, I know.  I feel like I keep this part like, most-I try not to let people know about it, because I know that it's kind of crazy. And I don't-again, I don't want to put it on my kids. I don't want them to have to live with that.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt":"", "completion": "You spend a lot of time really protecting people."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Like protecting them from knowing that I-", "completion": "Protecting them knowing, protecting them from tragedy, worrying about lots of different people who you love. Who protects you?"} 
{"prompt": "Just me. I mean,  I do. I-my mom was always a little bit like this, so I do blame some of this on her.", "completion":""} 
{"prompt": "So I-", "completion": "Talk about how she did-how did she do it?"} 
{"prompt": "Oh, she just always was worried, and I've been really mad at her in the last few years because she'll bring up some concern, and I'm like, if I haven't thought of that concern yet, I certainly don't need to hear it from you, because I've thought of every concern. So I've told her, you have to stop putting your worry on me, because I've got enough. And I've been really clear that I don't want to live that way. She thinks that I am way more this way than she was. I don't know if that's true.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "But.", "completion": "So some of it you feel like you've gotten from your mom over the years, and that she was a little bit like this."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "You're not sure-maybe she's even more than you or less than you."} 
{"prompt": "I don't think she tried to hide it from us.", "completion": "Ah. She just sort of explicitly worried about your safety."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Yeah.", "completion": "You and your siblings?"} 
{"prompt": "My sister and my brother. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I don't think she tried to hide it from us. I am really determined that my kids will live a fun life.", "completion": "You'll not only protect them from tragedy, but you'll protect them from their perception of you worrying too much."}
