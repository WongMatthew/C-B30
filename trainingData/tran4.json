{"prompt": "I wanted to changed my life so that I didn't have so much stress in my life. I was an independent consultant. I worked, you know, 80 hours, 90 hours a week consistently for seven, eight years. You know, I didn't get to see my children kind of thing, even though I worked in the home. And it was kind of like, I'd fall asleep at my desk, wake up and keep working-that kind of feeling. And I'ml ike, I need to change, and thankfully I had an opportunity to go teach, which is what I really wanted to do. And that's been fantastic, but at the same time, what I do is I tend to go, oh, you know what would be really fun is I could do this. And I could help you do this.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "You know, I'm trying to reduce that in my life, for or, as my wife says, try to create barriers so that you say-you can say no. And I have a hard time saying no.", "completion": "Yeah. So saying no is hard. So your wife, who knows you well, is saying, OK, Michael, maybe you can build a barrier that would allow you to say no."} 
{"prompt": "Right. Right. And, you know, and then of course I have my family in there-of course very helpful, but they have lots of needs, as well. They have their own internal issues going on, and they have me in the middle trying to help mediate their issues.", "completion": "You mean larger family, not just your kids."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah, larger family. Family origin. And so it's-they have issues within themselves.", "completion": "Sure."} 
{"prompt": "But I'm the rational one. I can help them. And so I'm their sounding boards on both sides. We're having issues. Can you help me deal with that?", "completion": "Wow. Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "And how do you say no? Well, I don't know, and I try, but it's difficult. And but it causes me a lot of stress. It causes me a lot stress because I don't want to take a side for somebody.", "completion": "Right."} 
{"prompt": "I don't-even know I clearly see all you really need is, honestly, why don't you go see a counselor, is what I want to say.", "completion": "Yeah. Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "But on one hand, one person says, you know, counselors are just friends-which then I have that going through my head too.", "completion": "Sure."} 
{"prompt": "And then I have on the other hand the other one, like, oh, I don't need a counselor. I can figure this out on my own. So I'm like, but you use me.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "You know? Yeah, you buy me lunch, but, you know, it's not-", "completion": "So if they're paid friends, you're not getting much of a salary out of this, are you. [LAUGHTER]"} 
{"prompt": "But and I want to be there for them, but it's just difficult, and I can feel it. I mean, it's the craziest thing, but I can feel it. But it's such a strange disease in some ways, because I just keep thinking myself, but it's not cancer. So what do I have to complain about?", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "What's-why am I-why am I complaining about something-OK, so I have an upset stomach. So I have digestive troubles that last for a few days. But, you know, I have drugs, and they mostly help. You know, and-", "completion": "So-"} 
{"prompt": "I don't know. And it's hard. It's hard. You know? I don't really know how to actually wrap my mind around it. I'm still-", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "I feel like it's, uh-when somebody told me once that it's kind of like, um, the stages of grief, right? Where I feel like I'm still oscillating between anger and denial, and I'm wanting to get to acceptance, but I just keep brushing it and thinking, I'm almost there. No I'm not. And I just keep going back and forth like, ugh.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "Because I feel angry that I can't-I can't exercise like I used to. I mean, I used to-and my doctor says, oh, you'll be able to get back to triathlon. You'll be able to get back to marathons. But I can't even run. I mean, it hurts so much. And I'm like, gosh, you know, I use to just gut this out. I should just do that. But I know that if I do, I damage myself worse. And I know that when I have already, that I'm just-I have to lay on the couch for a couple of days.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "I mean, I feel that bad. And when I feel bad, then it's like, oh, yeah, all the stuff that I'm telling you, it doesn't even bother me, because I'm just too tired. I hurt too much. It's like, when your body says you're done, you're done.  You know?", "completion": "So you throw yourself at everything as hard as you can, and then you hit this wall. You're out for a while. Then nothing matters, because it hurts so bad. You're so exhausted. You're forced to be on the couch."} 
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "Then you recover."} 
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "Then-"} 
{"prompt": "You start thinking about all the little things again.", "completion": "You're back there."} 
{"prompt": "And I want-I would like to get to a place where I can find some contentedness in just being OK with this is what I'm-this is what I can do. I try to create a mantra, right, where I'm like, just be thankful for what you can do, not continue wishing what you could do or remember what you used to be able to do. And I try to be thankful for that. I think, OK, I went for a ride today, and I'm really thankful that I could just go out for a ride today. But then I was like, gosh, you know, I used to be able to-you know? Just in the back of my mind. I used to be able to do this. I used to.", "completion": "Right."} 
{"prompt": "And so in some ways, I feel-I just kind of get mad at myself, like, OK. Be OK with it. Be OK with it.", "completion": "So there's this type A talking to type B, right?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And then type B is talking back to type B and-"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Yeah. And you know, and I just-and I feel guilt. I worry that something is going to make it so that I can't teach. That's the one thing that I really love to do, and my work. I love computer science. I loved writing software. But I really teaching. And so for me, if I couldn't teach, that would be really hard for me.", "completion": "So you've had this style in life of, I'm going to just say, gutsing it through, being your own central physician. I mean, the story goes all the way back to you're the central problem-solver, and had the energy to figure out what was going on, right?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Network, internet, resources. So you get that figured out, and now I've arrived in this spot where you know what's going on, but you're questioning if the style you've had your whole life is going to work with this new management issue, with the disorder."} 
{"prompt": "Right. Right.", "completion": "And I'm hearing a little fear."} 
{"prompt": "Oh, yeah. Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. Because I mean, it just comes back to-I mean, for me, anyway, I have issues with even my masculinity sometimes. And so then to have a disease that makes you feel like you can't do all the things you used to be able to do, it all of a sudden is-you're already a face. You know, I already have relatives that tell me, well, you just need to toughen up. I was like, well, I would like to, but the intestines say no. And that's not one of those things that are very comfortable to talk about, either. Again, it's kind of like, when you have cancer, you say, I have cancer. And it kind of trumps all, right? Everybody's like, well, you're done.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "You know, well, you win, kind of thing.", "completion": "Exactly."} 
{"prompt": "And I don't actually want to win. I just want to be, in some ways, left alone. And I don't want somebody to tell me toughen up. I don't want somebody to tell me, it's gonna be OK. Everything's OK. I don't even know exactly what I want. But I have these-I don't even really tell people, and that's the part that makes it kind of hard and strange, is I don't actually share this with anybody. So when I have people that are somewhat strangers coming up to me and saying, how are you feeling? I feel like, I don't know you, and I feel a little nervous now. So I-", "completion": "Right. A little nervous, a little ashamed, a little resentful that this is your story, and you really don't want to have to tell it every time you turn around."} 
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "And how much do you really want to know?", "completion": "Right."} 
{"prompt": "Because I have this person that actually, just by pure happenstance, I raced with him a lot in triathlon over the last five years. He's a nice guy. And we just had a nice rapport with each other. And I saw him the other night when my wife and I went out for a date. I'm like, hey, it's good to see you.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "And he's like, hey.", "completion": "Hey, how are you?"} 
{"prompt": "You didn't race this last weekend. What happened?", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "I'm like-and I just paused. And Karen's like, I'm going through my mind thinking, I don't even know who this person is. Does Michael know this person? I'm like, uhh, and then she's like, and I'm like, well, I just got sick. And he's like, oh, OK, no problem. She's like-and she asked me about it later. I'm like, I'm also just trying to think of the right response for the moment.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "Because I don't know him that well, but I don't-I didn't want to be untruthful. I didn't want to say something that wasn't true, but I-she's like, I honestly just didn't know how much you were going to go into it. I'm like, I don't know-I don't know him that well, and I think it would've been a little uncomfortable for him. And-", "completion": "So it's almost like inside you're going, I know this person a little bit, but this is my private journey, and I don't know how much I really want to share."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "So that part has been a little hard for me. JOHN: As I was watching you, Rita, with Michael, I couldn't help but notice that Michael was talking a lot. And that's great. It's really, really good to have a client that's verbal and talking a lot. But I also thought to myself, huh, that makes it even, maybe, a little harder.", "completion": "It's a little trickier. JOHN: It makes it trickier, harder to make contact, to connect, because it's hard to have your presence felt in the interaction. And so you were, I think, working hard, doing some paraphrases. And, of course, I, really obviously like it. I liked it when you did the walking within technique, and you did that just before the break in this session. I'm always impressed with that.", "completion": "Yeah. And I think it worked, because we saw Michael shift from some of his probably more mundane issues to mentioning things like a little fear or a threat to his masculinity, which made me feel like, wow, we've dropped a level here in terms of trust and deepened into. JOHN: It's a little surprising that you could get to big issues so quickly, just using some non-directive person-centered approaches.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. Yeah. In this next section, we'll watch a little bit more, as Michael, I think, works on his world view and- JOHN: And really kind of his way of being in the world.", "completion": "Right. Exactly. So let's watch."} 
{"prompt": "And you know, I try to read. I try to figure out different things. And sometimes it just feels so overwhelming. And honestly, because the disease has such a wide range of how people are affected, I have a hard time thinking, well, it's not like I've had my colon removed. It's not like I've been in the hospital every time.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "And, you know, and then I also-it's always interesting too, because they're always like, the people that do find out, like, gosh, I have known so many people that have that disease. Like, it's like, that's so interesting.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "I'm like, I guess.", "completion": "Yeah. Interesting, yeah. But I notice a lot of times when you tell me about what's going on inside of you, I'm hearing this internal scolding pattern. It's like you get in touch with a feeling-maybe resentment, maybe guilt, maybe sadness-and then you yell at yourself in there, and say, well, at least you've still got part of your colon. What are you complaining about?"} 
{"prompt": "Right.  It's true. It's true. It's like this quit-feeling-sorry- for-yourself feeling. Maybe it was the way I was raised. I don't know. Because, I mean, I didn't-it wasn't like I was-I mean, of course I've had a lot of blessings in my life that I feel so thankful for. And so I really think about that a lot-thinking about, gosh. And I've always had that problem growing up, thinking, gosh, I have been given so much in my life. And it's not like I haven't had my share of issues, obviously. But I just feel like I've been given so many things. You know? I was adopted. I could have been left on this doorstep where I would have most likely died.", "completion": "Right."} 
{"prompt": "But I was brought here, and I got to live this amazing life, so what do I have to complain about? So that's what kind of goes through my-that's the dialog that goes through my head, like, yeah, I've had this bad thing happen, but, you know, it could've been worse. It could've been, you know, whatever. I could've lost my arms or I could've-I could be dead. You know, so I kind of go to those extremes, sometimes. I'm sitting there on the couch, it's dark. The dogs are sleeping or snoring. And I'm just sitting there like, OK. One more hour. I can make it. I can make it. You know, in those times, I'm like, OK, I can feel sorry for myself for a little while, because no one's awake. No one's depending on me. Nobody's needing anything. And so it's that time.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "You know? And, but then I'm like, OK, it's going to be all right. And I can take another drug here, and I'm going to be fine now, and I'm going to feel good. And so-", "completion": "So even when you're feeling sorry for yourself in these really private quiet times, part of the message you're giving yourself is, the drugs-it'll be better in a little while. So it's not that all the way down to just why is this happening to me?"} 
{"prompt": "No. And that's the part that I'm a little afraid of doing, honestly. I am. I'm afraid of going to that level. Like, because, in some ways in my mind, I think, gosh, you're just whining, or you're just complaining, you know, and I don't complain.", "completion": "So that inner-we'll call him Mr. Type A. But that inner thing is not letting you face into the despair side of this. Boy, you just get scolded right back away from that."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Pretty quick. I mean, I'll get there, and I'll feel bad. I'll even-I mean, I can't even weep about it, at times. Because I'm just like, no, it's not. It's fine. It's going to be OK. And that's where my feelings of guilt-you know, when my wife has to make two different dinners, one that the children will eat and one that will work for me.", "completion": "That will work for you. Right."} 
{"prompt": "You know? And she's happy to do it, but it makes me feel bad. And I'm like, honestly, let's just make a bunch stuff, stick it in the freezer, and I'll just pull it out so that I'm not bothering anybody. You know? But she's like, it's fine. It's fine. But it makes me feel bad.", "completion": "So this goes all the way back to parental messages of get up there and take a lot of room in the world. And what I'm hearing is you really don't know how much space you should take up in the world."} 
{"prompt": "Right.", "completion": "You just don't know."} 
{"prompt": "Right. And that's the part I don't-which is fascinating, because my alter ego in front of the classroom is I can be as big as I want-not in a bad way. And I mean, one of the things-and, you know, I always think, for me, since I love teaching so much, I think about it all the time. It gives me a lot of life. And I think about just my own theories on how I teach-because I was never taught formally. I mean, I wasn't like-I didn't go to education school. I wish I would have.", "completion": "Right."} 
{"prompt": "And I was like, but I've made up my own theories on just common sense, in my mind, but just creating this atmosphere of community, creating this atmosphere of respect between your students, and not where they feel like they're able to run you over, but where we can have a true dialog, and have this conversation.", "completion": "Right."} 
{"prompt": "But I feel like I can just do whatever I want to in that arena. And-", "completion": "Right. That's where you're at home."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah, absolutely.", "completion": "That's where you can take up all the space you need."} 
{"prompt": "And it's fascinating. Because I tell my wife this. When I get in front of the classroom, it's like sometimes I'm so lost in what's going on, it's like I have to snap back into reality when I'm done. Like, I'm always like, oh, wow, the hour's over. And everyone's engaged, and everyone's there, and everyone's participating. And we just created this whole nother world for an hour, an hour and a half. And I'm like, oh, that was weird. And it was the one thing that was helping me take my mind off of the things that were hurting me during all that time.", "completion": "Yeah. That's the flow or the muse or whatever. You're there."} 
{"prompt": "So my stomach or my digestion-all of that was just distraught and just all this pain. But I'd get in front of the classroom, and just for that hour, it could just go away, unless it was really bad.", "completion": "Sure."} 
{"prompt": "But I could even figure out ways to accommodate myself. I'd go to the restroom before class, and be like, OK, no, I'm good for a while. But it's just like, it's like my mind could just disappear for a while, and I could just let it go. And even all my little things that bother me, they're let go, just for that. And I imagine that's exactly- and you say muse, that's exactly what I imagine artists and painters. That's where they get. They get to this place where the world's gone, and they're just-and that's exactly how I feel. I'm there, and I'm just so into it all.", "completion": "Yeah. Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "And all these really emergent things come out of it. I mean, to me, I see teaching as an organic process, as this feeling of all these things that come out of it, that life comes out of that I didn't even imagine. I prepare. There's no doubt.", "completion": "Sure."} 
{"prompt": "But do I go into different worlds? Yeah. But I see it as a story. I mean, every lecture, every class is a story. It's not me disseminating information. Sure, I have to give information, but I see it more of as this, we're going to talk about this story that starts at the beginning of week one, and we're going to bring it back to week 15. And so when I bring it back in week 15, they're like, oh my gosh, you remember that? I'm like, see? You realize that it's all connected. Everything's all connected. Maybe it's Buddhist or something. And I just think, but it's so true. Even in the world of computer science, everything's so connected, and that's really an interesting thing. That's what I love about it so much. And, you know? I don't know.", "completion": "So one of your questions is really could that me that's found this home, this peace, this balance, could that me be in other parts of my life?"} 
{"prompt": "Yes. Yes.", "completion": "Could I bring this over and find that balance, that peace, the story?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Because, I mean, even when I exercise-not as much now, because, of course, I just can't, physically, but before, I had a hard time just going out for a bike ride to enjoy the weather, enjoy the scenery. I was thinking how much time? Can I do it faster? Can I go a little bit faster? Can I push myself a little harder?", "completion": "Right."} 
{"prompt": "I'm like, what happened to just going out and enjoying the ride? You know? And I berate myself a little bit over that, and be just like, gosh, why can't you just go out and ride just to ride? And in some ways, I'm really thankful, because now I truly am thankful.", "completion": "Now that question is for real. Yeah."}
