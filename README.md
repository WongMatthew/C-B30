# ChatGPT chat bot for emotional relief and comfort 

## Imports cause im too lazy to make a docker container for everything 

```pip3 install --upgrade revChatGPT``` 

you might need to add --user if you're not running command from admin

```pip install flask``` 

```pip install -U flask-cors``` 

```npm install```

## Notes

The FE has to pass in None/Null in the json during the first API call

Grab new session token every day or else you'll run auth error
