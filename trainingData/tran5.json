{"prompt": "And at the same time, I think there's an element of either perfectionism or something like that, that when I experience those moments, or I think I do, that it may get a little blown up in terms of its magnitude, or overgeneralized in some way. So it can be-and that's why, I guess, laughter feels like the appropriate response, as I wrestle with those disparities in some point.", "completion": "And so the anxiety, what kind of-from the stomach to the chest, and then now it's sort of turned into laughter, feeling a little bit silly about it."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "I want us to try something, if it's OK. And one of the things in Gestalt therapy is that we do things we call experiments."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "And so if you don't mind, I'm actually going to get out of this chair and we're going to do a thing that we call the empty chair technique."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "And I'll move back. And I hear two sort of distinct parts in there, one part being anxiety. And so I'd like you to put anxiety in this chair."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "And have you, in that chair-and you have a conversation with the anxiety in more of an active way."} 
{"prompt": "OK. OK.", "completion": "Does that make sense?"} 
{"prompt": "I think so.", "completion": "If at any point you have questions, let me know, and I'll sit back here and I'll make some comments as you talk to your anxiety."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "OK?"} 
{"prompt": "OK. So anything I want to say to my anxiety.", "completion": "Anything you want to say to it is a place to start."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "And then the anxiety will get a chance to speak as well."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "All right? So I'm slipping back here. And so we put the anxiety right here."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "And-or here."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "And you just tell the anxiety what you would like it to know."} 
{"prompt": "OK. I guess I would like you to know that I'm not always clear and sure as to why you show up and as to what your function is, if there is a useful function. I think sometimes a little bit of you might be fine, but a lot of you is not fine, and is counterproductive in a way.", "completion": "Kind of like, I don't know why you're here sometimes."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Certainly I don't know why a lot of you is here. Maybe a little bit of you is OK."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Move over and be the anxiety and talk back to Sydney. What do you have to say to Sydney, who's now in that chair?"} 
{"prompt": "Well, Sydney, I guess I would say that I'm here to make sure that you do what you're supposed to do and that you stay on track, and that you have some negative feeling, which is me, associated with behaviors that don't fit with your values. So that's why I'm here, is to remind you of when your behavior doesn't fit well with your values. [JOHN gestures for Sydney to move back to his original chair to respond to his anxiety. Sydney moves back to his original chair.]"} 
{"prompt": "Well, I would respond to that by saying, you have a good point. At the same time, you can be a little excessive sometimes. It's good for me to have reminders that encourage me to be motivated to align with what I believe and my values, at the same time, sometimes you reach a point to where that isn't helpful anymore, where there's too much of you in the picture. [JOHN gestures for Sydney to move to the chair and respond as his anxiety. Sydney moves back to his original chair.]"} 
{"prompt": "OK. So, that is an interesting point. And I could see how too much of me could be debilitating-too much of anxiety, of me, could be debilitating. And so perhaps-yeah. You have a good point. I'm not sure what else to say about that. Part of me wants to say I will temper myself down a little bit or tone it down a little bit so that I'm not so in-your-face at times when maybe you need just a little bit of me, as you've made clear. So part of me wants to say that, that I'll temper it a little bit.", "completion": "OK. Let's go back to Sydney and just talk a couple minutes, or maybe just a few seconds, and then I want to guide you through another little piece of this."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "What comes up for you as you do this dialogue?"} 
{"prompt": "I think the first thing that comes up is seeing-or feeling, not just seeing-but I guess this feeling level of feeling like this anxiety is just another part of me that I, Sydney, have some measure of control over, that perhaps I sometimes forget or I'm not aware of-that this is a part of me that sometimes I want to push away and say it's an external thing that's acting on my life in a way that has a negative impact sometimes. And through this empty chair activity, it feels as if-verbalizing from the standpoint of anxiety makes me feel like it's just a part of me, and like other parts of me, I have some self-determination in how it shows up, to what degree, and see the utility of that voice within certain boundaries, I guess and limitations.", "completion": "OK. So what I'd like you to do is to talk again to the anxiety. Begin by saying, thank you, anxiety. I hear you wanting to be helpful."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "And then maybe ask the anxiety, are you worried that I might not live up to my own values?"} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "And so just try to-again, find your own words, I guess, for that."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "But that kind of message. And then go over and be the anxiety."} 
{"prompt": "OK. OK. So, anxiety, I appreciate your concern for me and wanting to make sure that I live in alignment with my values. And I thank you for that, for keeping me on track in that regard. And I also hear that you're concerned that without doing that, or without a certain degree of that, that I will slip in some way.", "completion": "I'd like to hear what anxiety has to say in [Sydney moves to the other chair to respond as his anxiety.]"} 
{"prompt": "So I hear what you're saying, Sydney, and, I-I think that this discussion between us has been good in the sense that it lets me know that I play an important role in your life of being there to serve as a motivator, as even an inspiration, perhaps, in some way, but also that I can overstep my bounds. And so thank you for sharing that with me, as this discussion helps me figure out how much of me is the right amount, how much is too much and is unhelpful.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. So while you're in the anxiety chair-anxiety, I heard Sydney saying to you that he appreciates you."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "He values you."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And thanked you. And what does that feel like to you, to anxiety?"} 
{"prompt": "To anxiety?", "completion": "What's it feel like?"} 
{"prompt": "I think I kind of smile, I guess, because I feel like perhaps I've been told by Sydney that you shouldn't be here. You should be gone, abolished from existence in some way. So that's the first thing that comes up.", "completion": "In some ways it feels validating?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah, like it's OK for me to be here as part of you, as part of your life, in a way.", "completion": "Yeah. You have a purpose. You have a function."} 
{"prompt": "I have a purpose and a function, yes, as opposed to being in this tug-of-war, in a way, where Sydney's always trying to kick me out.", "completion": "One thing we didn't do with the dream, because you went through it speaking first person. But what you didn't do was we didn't give you a chance to try on some of the entities in the dream."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And so what I'd like you to do now if you're OK with it is to go back through the dream, and I'll just prompt you to put on the different entities, and to be the different parts of the dream."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "OK?"} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "So, are you ready?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah, I think so.", "completion": "Deep breath. How about you begin and you are the canoe."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "I know that seems kind of funny, but just say, I am the canoe, and I'm-"} 
{"prompt": "OK. I am the canoe, and I'm going down the river, downstream. I have two paddlers sitting within me. I'm not sure if they know what they're doing or not. And they start to turn me a little bit sideways to the current, and I start to tip over to the side just a bit.", "completion": "I am tipping over."} 
{"prompt": "I am tipping over. And as I'm tipping over, I begin to fill with water from the left side. And it starts pouring over my side, and I'm filling with water. Then I start to level off and come back to a upright position. And I reorient, and I'm floating downstream. I'm now-", "completion": "I'm filling with water, I'm filled partway with water?"} 
{"prompt": "Almost all the way, three quarters.", "completion": "I'm almost all filled with water."} 
{"prompt": "Almost all filled with water-three quarters of the way filled with water.", "completion": "And how does that feel as the canoe, to be almost filled with water?"} 
{"prompt": "Heavy.", "completion": "I feel heavy."} 
{"prompt": "Burdened. Burdened, yeah, and heavy.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. OK."} 
{"prompt": "Unwieldy. I feel unwieldy, burdened, heavy."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Right.", "completion": "OK. And as you say those words, does that connect with anything for you?"} 
{"prompt": "I think it connects with moments that I experience- heavy, burdened. Unwieldy, not so much, but heavy and burdened. And I would say not in the big picture of my life, but right now it's near the end of the semester. It's sort of a crunch time for me, and I feel heavy and burdened, definitely in the last week or two, and I'm sort of anticipating that it will continue for another two weeks, that heaviness and that burden of having-and I guess the metaphor there is sort of having more than I can manage, which is what the canoe is experiencing.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. Just kind of drifting down the river now."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah, and overflowing, as it were, with the burden, with the heaviness, in a way.", "completion": "I'm overflowing with the burden."} 
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Yeah. OK. And still heading down the river."} 
{"prompt": "And still-still, yep, following the path of least resistance, in some way it seems, or going with the flow of what the environment is telling me. The river is saying, you need to go this way, which is the direction of the current. And it's going to be a lot of work to go in the other direction. And even though you may be heavy and burdened, that's the direction we're going to encourage you or push you in, even. Yeah.", "completion": "And the burden right now feels like all the stuff that you have on your plate for the end of the semester."} 
{"prompt": "That's right.", "completion": "And now let's just shift a little bit, and you become the river."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "I am the river."} 
{"prompt": "OK. I am the river. I'm flowing. I'm dynamic. I'm pushing all sorts of things downstream-canoes, sticks, bugs, debris, rocks. I'm flowing. I'm moving. I'm a little bit-a little bit murky. My clarity is not that good to come full circle to clarity. It's a little murky. I have a lot of different features. There's places of calm water, places of faster water, places where there's log jams, obstructions, rocks.", "completion": "There's a lot. There's a lot, to me."} 
{"prompt": "There's a lot. I'm diverse. I'm diverse and dynamic and changing.", "completion": "What's it feel to say that?"} 
{"prompt": "It feels-the first thing that it feels is this connection with what I just mentioned about anticipating the next two weeks to be busy. The first thing that I felt was sort of this connection with how rivers change with the season-how the snow melts and they come up and they flow big and swollen, and lack of clarity. They're murky. You can't see as well. And they're more brown, and more debris is floating down as the runoff collects all of those things.", "completion": "There's so much going on that it's murky."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "And then as the season progresses, the water level starts to lower. It becomes more tranquil, calmer. You can look into it and see fish over here, and the bottom over here. So the clarity of the river increases as that period of time that is a natural changing in the seasons sort of waxes and wanes.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Do you have a part of the year that feels more clear to you, and still?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. I think the summer. I think the summer does, yeah.", "completion": "OK. Let's take one more object in the dream and explore it a little bit, if that's OK."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "How about you become the other paddler."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "I am in the front of the boat, and Sydney is behind me."} 
{"prompt": " I laugh because the first thing that pops into my awareness is the comment, I don't know what I'm doing, and it sounds like Sydney doesn't know what he's doing either. He's not telling me what to do in a way that makes sense, that is clear. So to speak from that perspective of that paddler, I'm confused. I'm frightened. I have the tools that I need, such as this paddle, in my hand, but I don't have the internal tools, such as the knowledge and skill that I need. And the person that I'm looking to for that isn't being effective in transmitting that knowledge and skill to me.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "And, um-and I also feel, as the first paddler, some sense of, oh well. Like, a little bit like those things are true that I said-not having the skill-but, oh well, the consequence isn't that great. It's almost as if either I don't know what the consequences are-sort of an ignorance is bliss thing. I don't know that it's a big deal to flip the canoe and perhaps capsize and all of that. But just that, uh, yeah, it's no big deal.", "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "I'll just roll with it.", "completion": "Does this-you'll just roll with it."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Yeah. So I don't have the skills I need. I'm not getting great help. And yet I'm not terribly upset about this or concerned. I have a little bit of an ignorance is bliss attitude."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Does that connect to anything in your life?"} 
{"prompt": "I was suspended." , "completion": "I really just want you to describe some of the patterns, some of the behaviors, some of the things that you were doing that led to the suspension."} 
{"prompt": "Right." , "completion": "So, I'm just going to show you this questionnaire, so you have an idea of what I'm doing."} 
{"prompt": "OK." , "completion": "And this will be part of their reinstatement process, if you do choose to go that route. And I guess I should get a feeling, before we continue on-do you want to be in school?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Yeah, I definitely want to be in school. I like school. Like, I don't want to not be in school." , "completion": "OK. what about school do you like? What keeps you here on the university campus?"} 
{"prompt": "Well, I have really good friends here. Like, I feel like I've made really good friends. And like, I don't want to have a bad job. Like, I want to get a degree so I can have a good job. Yeah. I don't know. Like, I think the town is pretty and the campus is pretty. And I mean, I'm pretty happy here." , "completion": "Mm-hmm. And what do you think kept you from going to class as regularly as you did when you were in high school? What kept you attending your college classes on a regular basis?"} 
{"prompt": "Well, I think, for one, I don't have, like, my mom like making me get up when I'm tired. And, I don't know. I don't think I like, love my classes. And because it's like an option to not go-like sometimes I'm just really tired. And it's hard, too, because like the schedule's so different. Because like, with high school, I had to be there at 7:45 every morning. It was always the same. But like now it's like, Tuesday mornings I can like, sleep in, but like, Wednesday mornings and Monday mornings, I have to get up early. And I don't know. I think it's really hard to adjust to that, because you don't have the same schedule all the time." , "completion": "OK. So you need a little more consistency. You feel like that might help you."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. I mean, because your body gets all whacked out when you're like, sleeping late and then staying up late, but your body never knows what to expect, really. I think that's like, part of the problem. Yeah." , "completion": "OK. So I'm just going to show this questionnaire to you. And there's a couple-well, there's several options to choose from. And I want you just to pick a couple of those options as far as what you think contributed to your academic difficulties."} 
{"prompt": "OK. Yeah, I mean, I think those are the main ones." , "completion": "OK. All right. So poor attendance, time management problems, and too much partying."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah." , "completion": "All three of those are very common for incoming freshmen, or freshman, I should say."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah." , "completion": "It's the first time you're away from your parents, and just the independence that you are discovering and trying to find your own boundaries, and all of that's very common."} 
{"prompt": "Right." , "completion": "The too much partying is also another common experience for freshman. The University can be fun. They're so much to do-"} 
{"prompt": "Right. And it's not like I'm like drinking all the time. I'm just like, with my friends. So sometimes I go out, and I'm not even like, have a drink, but it's just like, hanging out with them, you know?" , "completion": "Yeah. I think the social aspect is what gets most teens-or most freshmen. Sorry."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah." , "completion": "Just because you have-you know, you don't have anybody saying, you have to be home at midnight, or you have to get up to go to school at 8:00. You know? Nobody's checking on you, and it's the first time you're just out being independent and making those decisions. So I can definitely see where that can come into play, which then affects the attendance."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah." , "completion": "Because you're out late, even though you're not maybe doing something that you're not supposed to be doing. You're just out late."} 
{"prompt": "Right." , "completion": "Which that means you're not ready to go the next morning."} 
{"prompt": "Right. See, it's not even like I'm hungover. It's just like, I like, can't get up when my alarm goes off. I, physically, I'm just like, so tired. You know?" , "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "Which I don't mean to be, but." , "completion": "Yeah. Just so that I can better help you, if you don't mind just describing a typical day for me. That way, it just gives me insight into what's maybe some of the other obstacles are. And so I have a worksheet here for a schedule, and let's just take, for example, Monday class day, and what that typically looks like."} 
{"prompt": "OK." , "completion": "So when's your first class-for this past semester, when was your first class?"} 
{"prompt": "9:40 is when I start class on Mondays." , "completion": "OK. And what class is that?"} 
{"prompt": "Religion of America." , "completion": "OK. OK. And then do you have any other classes on Monday?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Then at-let's see. I think it's like, 1:10. 9:40- yeah. 1:10, I have Shamanism." , "completion": "OK. So a nice break in between."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah." , "completion": "All right. And then any other classes on Monday?"} 
{"prompt": "Not on Mondays." , "completion": "OK. So your Religion of Americans-why did you decide to take that course?"} 
{"prompt": "It was just like one of the courses that was still available. Like, I feel like I kind of had a late registration, and like, I didn't really know what else to take, and I've heard really good things about that professor." , "completion": "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That specific course is actually an upper division course, and so that might be why you had some difficulty with that."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah." , "completion": "Usually when you're taking a 300 or a 400-level course, you want your writing skills. You at least want your English composition course out of the way, because there's a lot of [UNINTELLIGIBLE]."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. I've noticed that. Like, they're all like, the older kids, and they kind of-I don't know. It's just like, it's easier for them, I think." , "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah." , "completion": "Also with upper divisions there are sometimes prerequisites that aren't-there's no way in the system to prevent you from registering for a class with a prerequisite, and so that might be another problem, is they expected you to have a foundational knowledge before jumping into that one, and you just skipped that."} 
{"prompt": "Right." , "completion": "And that's where I come in. I help with the academic advising. And we can talk about that a little bit more later."} 
{"prompt": "OK." , "completion": "The Sha- Shama- Shamanism-"} 
{"prompt": "Shamanism. Yeah." , "completion": "-class, how was that class for you?"} 
{"prompt": "You know, it's interesting, but like, I don't know. Not exactly what I want to study. And again, it was like something that was free that fit in my schedule. But I don't know, like-I don't love the professor, and I mean, I'm not-I don't want to be a Shaman, you know?" , "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "And I mean, those are both kind of like religious studies courses, and that's not really my thing, so." , "completion": "OK. So, as part of the reinstatement process, you have to agree to do some of these things. So it's really important that you understand all-because this is basically a contract that helps you, that keeps you on track for what you should be doing in the fall, to help you be a successful student."} 
{"prompt": "OK. So I can for sure come back in the fall?" , "completion": "Actually, not for sure yet."} 
{"prompt": "OK." , "completion": "What I'll do is go through this plan with you, and then after that, we'll call over to the dean's office, get you an appointment with them. And they actually do the reinstatement. They're the ones that decide."} 
{"prompt": "OK." , "completion": "So remember in the beginning I said it's important that you're really honest with me about everything."} 
{"prompt": "OK." , "completion": "And the dean will ask the same, because what we want to do is make sure that you're ready to be back in school, and that this is the, first of all, the right university for you and the right time for you to be here."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah." , "completion": "And it's not about keeping out of school or not about not wanting to encourage. It's just about making sure it's the right thing for you right now."} 
{"prompt": "Right, yeah." , "completion": "It's not a-I guess it's not a form of punishment, but it's definitely a process to make sure that you're ready to be here."} 
{"prompt": "OK." , "completion": "Do you have any other questions?"} 
{"prompt": "No." , "completion": "So just going back to the questionnaire. This part of the reinstatement plan is attending class, making sure that you attend all classes for the semester. And just reflecting back on the questionnaire that you had filled out at the beginning of our meeting, that was one of the problems that you identified, was your poor attendance."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. It's probably the biggest problem." , "completion": "OK. And so what-and I know you talked about the social, being social with your friends and staying out late. Was there anything else that kept you from going to class?"} 
{"prompt": "So, yeah. Just sleeping in, and, I don't know. I guess like, they don't take attendance all the time, and I didn't really think it was that big of a deal. Like, I mean, I don't always miss class, so I just-I guess I didn't think it was that big of a deal. And, I mean, sometimes it's boring, and I'd rather do something else. Like when it's nice out, I don't want to go to that class, where I'm like, already not doing that well." , "completion": "OK. Going to class is very important, and I know it's pretty easy not to do that. You've already talked about some of the obstacles that have-or the things that have prevented you from going to class. So I think this would be a great opportunity to brainstorm some possible solutions of you making sure that you make it to class, because we do, just in the different research, it shows students who attend class on a regular basis automatically do better than those who go occasionally."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah." , "completion": "So and I want to come up with things that will work for you, not things that I think will work, but things that you can do."} 
{"prompt": "Right." , "completion": "So maybe just thinking back to high school and the times where you did have your parents's guidance on getting to school and the importance of that. What were some of the things that worked that you could now to here as a student, as a college student?"} 
{"prompt": "Well, I think for me, if I get up the same time every day, it's easier." , "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "Because like I said, I don't have to get up early on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and so it's really hard on Mondays and Wednesdays." , "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "So maybe if I like, kind of got a pattern going so that it was easier. It's just so hard." , "completion": "OK. And that-we can definitely try to build a schedule that meets that needs. What are maybe a couple other things that would help you make it to class regularly?"} 
{"prompt": "Um, well, not staying up as late would be helpful." , "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "It's just hard, because I'm not really tired. Like, I'll look at the clock, and I'll see it's like 11:30, midnight, but, I mean, it feels like it's like 8:30 or 9:00. So I don't know-maybe telling my roommate. Because like, she's often like, the person that wants me to go to the University Center and get ice cream or like, watch a movie with her. And like, I'd like to, but it's kind of like a sleepover every night. So maybe I could just like tell her that I can't stay up late all the time." , "completion": "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. OK. So getting up at the same time each day, falling into that pattern, but also not staying up as late, which is also a sleep pattern."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah." , "completion": "So it sounds like a lot of this is around you getting rest, and that is very important. So what are just some natural-just some things that you would do to make sure that you went to bed early? Because nobody else is-you know, I'm not going to be there in your dorm at 9 o'clock at night or 10 o'clock at night, reminding you, oh, remember our agreement. What are some maybe just some things that you could do to monitor yourself and remind yourself that getting a good night's rest is important?"} 
{"prompt": "I could maybe like, put an alarm in my cell phone at like, 8:30, just like so I realize that it's like, getting a little bit later. Because it kind of sneaks up on me sometimes, that it's so late. And like, I've been taking a lot of naps. That's the other problem. So I'll like sleep in, and so I can't like, go to class. I'm so tired. But I'll get up, and then I'll take like, a nap like 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon, and then I can't go to bed early." , "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "So maybe like, just, like I could even like not take a nap once, then maybe I'd get in the right pattern, you know?" , "completion": "So you've talked about patterns a lot, so that sounds like it's a pretty-that's what helps you function, is finding a pattern, finding a daily schedule."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah, I guess that is kind of what it is." , "completion": "Mmm. And that's human nature. I think we all work better if we kind of know what to expect and how to set a schedule up for ourselves."} 
{"prompt": "Right." , "completion": "I know for me I have to have a to-do list each day at work, because I could be on email all day. But if I have a to-do list to follow, then that helps keep me organized for the day. So having your pattern. And what I'll also do is send you with one of these weekly schedules."} 
{"prompt": "OK." , "completion": "And you'll also practice-this'll be one of your assignments in the CNA Learning Strategies class is that you'll map out your class schedule. Then you'll also map out when you'll eat, when you'll study, if you are part of any intramurals or student activities, any of that, you'll build that into there, but you'll also build in your sleep time in there."} 
{"prompt": "OK." , "completion": "So you can visually see what your schedule looks like, even though you might not follow it to a T every day or even every week, it's Kind of nice reminder of, oh, yeah, on Wednesday nights, I was going to try to make it to bed by 11 o'clock or whatever."} 
{"prompt": "Right." , "completion": "Whatever's necessary. So that sounds like a great list. And I will definitely-what I'll do is add that to the reinstatement plan, because I will give you a copy of this so you remember what we talked about and you have it to refer to."} 
{"prompt": "OK." , "completion": "So the other thing that's important is that, you know, you've come up with this list of strategies to make sure that you are making it to class on a regular basis. But it's also important that if you're able to achieve these that you reward yourself."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm." , "completion": "And sometimes it's something simple like going out for ice cream with your friend when she asks you to. Other times it's maybe something bigger-going out and buying yourself a pair of shoes or something."} 
{"prompt": "Right." , "completion": "What maybe are some possible rewards that you could give yourself if you were able to follow this pattern that we talked about?"} 
{"prompt": "Um, well, maybe like me and my friends could go like, camping. We live like, pretty close to some good areas for that, so maybe we could go camping like at the end of the semester." , "completion": "OK. That sounds like a lot of fun."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. I think that would be fun. And ice cream's always fun. And shoes." , "completion": "Yeah.  So we relate on that level."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. I totally get that. That sounds like fun, actually." , "completion": "So camping with friends at the end of the semester. A camping trip sounds like it would be very rewarding, and kind of that ultimate what's keeping you motivated."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm." , "completion": "On a daily basis, though, you also kind of need some of those little motivators. So maybe what's something-that's a great overall goal to have. What's maybe something you could do to reward yourself?"} 
{"prompt": "Maybe-well, me and my roommate like to like, marathon TV shows. So maybe we could like, watch an episode on the days I go to class." , "completion": "Nice. Yes. That's a great idea."} 
{"prompt": "But not too late." , "completion": "So build that into your weekly schedule."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah." , "completion": "Not after your bedtime."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah." , "completion": "Now I sound like a mom, using the whole bedtime term."} 
{"prompt": " Yeah, well, it's easier. Like, I don't need a bedtime if I'm tired. It's just, I'm not getting tired at the right time, so." , "completion": "Yeah. And that will probably take you a while to get-because your body is now used to, you know, kind of having these late nights, late mornings."} 
{"prompt": "Right." , "completion": "And so to readjust to all of that will take you some time. So don't-I guess don't be too hard on yourself if tonight you practice trying to go to bed at 11 and you're not able to fall right asleep. It'll take you a while."} 
{"prompt": "Right." , "completion": "So definitely don't be too hard on yourself. Change is always gradual."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah." , "completion": "So we've talked about the overall consequences of maybe not following through with your plan. I think it's really helpful, too, if you look at maybe some little consequences that you can give yourself if you miss a class."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah." , "completion": "One example you used for a reward is watching one of your TV shows with your roommate. So maybe missing a class means you don't watch the TV show with your roommate. What are maybe some of those smaller consequences you can give yourself?"} 
{"prompt": "Ugh, like going to the library." , "completion": "Ooh."} 
{"prompt": "Like, maybe I would have to make myself go to the library for the amount of time that I was supposed to be in class." , "completion": "That is a great-"} 
{"prompt": "That would not be fun." , "completion": "Going to the library. Let's-maybe two more of those types of consequences."} 
{"prompt": "So like, not watching the episode of whatever TV show." , "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "And I don't know, maybe like scaling back of my weekend plans." , "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "Like taking one commitment out of the weekend that was something social I wanted to do." , "completion": "OK. Social plans. Those sound like very good and reasonable consequences for missing class. And you've kind of giving yourself a balance, too. You have some positive rewards, and then you have some consequences, as well."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah." , "completion": "And they're all doable, and they're all things that, you know, that you can hold yourself accountable to and don't really need anybody reminding you."} 
{"prompt": "Right." , "completion": "Just to keep you on track with your plan of getting into a pattern in your schedule, one of the things I want you to do is a self- monitoring assignment-nothing that's going to take a lot of time, just mainly keeping track of when you're going to bed at night and things like that so you can see what pattern you are in now. And so try to find those times of night that will give you enough time to get a full night's rest."} 
{"prompt": "OK." , "completion": "So let me give you this schedule. I'm going to give you this worksheet here. And you can just keep track of your bedtimes and what your schedule's like. And then you can also start-I'm going to give you a note pad, and you can also start logging down, from here on out, when you're going to bed and what not. That way, we have something visual to go back to when we meet again to check on your progress, just to see if you've come up with your own pattern."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah." , "completion": "Or you'll be able to identify, you know, oh, I'm always going to bed at midnight, and then I'm missing class that next day."} 
{"prompt": "Right." , "completion": "So you can identify that yourself."} 
{"prompt": "OK. So just keep track of like, when I'm going to bed and then when I'm missing class." , "completion": "Yeah. Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "But I can't miss any more class." , "completion": "Yes."} 
{"prompt": "OK." , "completion": "Yes, that would be the ultimate goal, for sure. Do you have any questions about that?"} 
{"prompt": "I don't think so. I mean, do I have to bring it back to you?" , "completion": "Yes. Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "OK." , "completion": "Because that'll help me do some more brainstorming if need be for getting you back on track and finding that pattern that you've been talking about, so."} 
{"prompt": "OK. Yeah, that sounds good." , "completion": "OK. So I'll go ahead and give you that worksheet there."} 
{"prompt": "And so I'll talk to the dean, and then will you let me know whether-" , "completion": "Actually the dean tells you right then and there whether you're reinstated or not."} 
{"prompt": "OK." , "completion": "So you'll know by the time you're done meeting with her."} 
{"prompt": "Hey.", "completion": "Well, Meredith, we know each other, but the way we usually start a CBT session is to set an agenda."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "And so we might have several ideas about what we want on the agenda, but the first thing is usually for us to make a problem list together about whatever it that you might want to work on."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "And then we'll do the problem list, and then we'll explore the thoughts and the behaviors that might be related to the problem. And hopefully by the end of our time together, we'll have a clear idea about what's causing the problem and some ideas about how to maybe change things."} 
{"prompt": "Sounds good.", "completion": "All right."} 
{"prompt": "So, one thing that I've been noticing lately is that I have a tendency to kind of hang back in groups, and I tend to observe instead of participate.", "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "And, a lot of times, I get really nervous when I feel like I'm expected to speak up. And I want to speak up, but I kind of feel like I freeze.", "completion": "OK. And so in particular then, in groups, the setting is big groups, little groups? Does it matter?"} 
{"prompt": "It doesn't matter a whole lot, but generally, I guess, medium-size-like, you know, in classes that I have. They're usually like maybe 12 people or so. So relatively small, medium. I don't know what size that is.", "completion": "OK. And so but in your head, you probably would say, I would like to speak up, but, for some reason, you feel inside some anxiety or nervousness about that."} 
{"prompt": "Definitely.", "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "And then sometimes when I try to force myself to speak up when I actually don't feel ready, I get like, I feel like my throat's closing, and I get a red face.", "completion": "OK. All right. So that's sort of one possible issue for issue for us to talk about. Could you maybe give me a specific example of a particular group situation, as recent as you can, where you had this feeling of hanging back and maybe some fear of evaluation."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. So in my statistics class, each week we have a-it's called an inclusion activity. And generally, I guess, that's supposed to help people feel like the group's more cohesive and included. But I usually experience it as the opposite. So there's usually a task at the beginning of each class of, like, take off your shoe and talk about the most interesting place your shoe has been. Stuff like that.", "completion": "In stats."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. That-usually I get really nervous, and I feel like I can't think of anything to say. And I feel like I usually end up saying something really awkward or lame, and I just don't feel good about it. Like, I feel-", "completion": "Yeah. Can you give me that specific example of the recent time when maybe-and what you said, too, including sort of the beginning, what happened, and then how it ended."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. So when we did this activity- it's like a really weird example.", "completion": "Yeah. All right."} 
{"prompt": "When we did this activity, probably six or seven people had gone in front of me, and I was like, not listening to anything that anyone else was saying, just total self-absorbed in terms of like, oh God, what am I going to say, and not being able to think of anything. And then when it was my turn, I was wearing a pair of shoes that like, are, kind of like, they have lace on them. And so I took it off and I said, I like these shoes because I get cool tan lines from them. So I didn't even really answer the question that was like, where have these shoes been, or like the coolest place these shoes have been, or something like that.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "And then after I went, I didn't really listen to anything else anyone said, because I was still like, stuck on why didn't I answer the question? And just kind of feeling awkward.", "completion": "OK. So what I'm doing here is I've got several columns that I'm building. And the first one is you're in the stats class, and you're going through and inclusion activity. And the second one is the thoughts that you're having, OK?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "What thoughts are going through your mind. And the thoughts are, oh God, what am I going to saying? Those are the early thoughts. And then maybe later thoughts are, why didn't I even answer the question?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. And like, why can't I ever be articulate?", "completion": "OK. Why can't I ever be articulate? OK. And then our third column are the emotions that you might be feeling. And so as you're in that situation and people are taking their turn-the teacher says, you're doing the inclusion activity. People are taking their turns. And what are you feeling? How would you describe your emotional state?"} 
{"prompt": "Mmm. Nervous.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Like, fearful.", "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "And, like, it's almost like I'm anticipating embarrassment.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "So I don't know if that's a feeling or not, but usually I feel embarrassed.", "completion": "I put that in the thought column."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "Just because it seems like the anticipation of it is probably a thought, but embarrassment, when you're in the middle of it, is probably a feeling."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Does that make sense?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And then so I got nervous, fearful, embarrassed as the emotions. And on a scale of zero, not at all, 100 being the most of that feeling you could ever have, how would you rate-let's get rid of nervous, because it's sort of covered by fearful. How would you rate fearful and how would you rate embarrassed?"} 
{"prompt": "Mmm, maybe fearful like, a four."} 
{"prompt": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "Or a five. I don't know.", "completion": "A 4 or a 5 out of 100?"} 
{"prompt": "Or I mean 45.", "completion": "OK, I was going to say. Oh, feeling pretty calm. So a 40 or a 50."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "OK. And embarrassed?"} 
{"prompt": "I'd say that's higher.", "completion": "A little higher."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah, like a 70.", "completion": "So maybe a 70. And that would be at the moment that you're talking, or right afterwards, or right before? Does it fluctuate at all?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. I'd say like, both during and after.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. OK."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "OK. So during and after. All right. And so you know the cognitive approach to thinking about what's going on is that it's not the situation that causes the emotional reaction, but it's what you're thinking that causes the emotional reaction."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And so it seems to me like one of the things that's going on- oh God, what am I going to say, and why I didn't I answer? Why can I never be articulate?"} 
{"prompt": " Why can't I never be articulate. That sounds exactly like-", "completion": "Yeah. It's perfect."} 
{"prompt":"", "completion": "We might have to start rating my anxiety now, too. And then I guess there's the other thing. You said that you're anticipating embarrassment. And so are those words too also that are going through your head?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Like, I wish I could be more clever or, I wish I could have just like a funny story right now or make people laugh in a way that I want them to laugh.", "completion": "And one of the things I'm doing now is a lot of times, when you think about the thoughts that trigger the emotions, these are the thoughts that we would categorize as less helpful."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "OK? Kind of unhelpful thoughts. And then over here what we're doing is we're coming up with some thoughts that might be more helpful. OK?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Recognizing that no thoughts are perfect, but some thoughts are more helpful. Some thoughts are less helpful."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And you know in your stats class, you're going to do the inclusion activity-"} 
{"prompt": "Every week.", "completion": "Every week. And so one possibility is you could come in prepared to shift your thinking from the less helpful to the more helpful."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Just an idea."} 
{"prompt": "That's a good idea.", "completion": "OK. So what else besides this is silly and what I say doesn't matter all that much?"} 
{"prompt": "Um, I can be clever sometimes.", "completion": "I can be clever sometimes. Good. That's sort of a counter to the why can't I ever be articulate-or why can't I never be articulate."} 
{"prompt":"", "completion": "Either way you say it. Well, let's pretend for a second that you were talking to a friend who had exactly this same scenario. And she was telling you the way that she talks to yourself-oh God, what am I going to say? And why can't I answer that? Why can't I ever be articulate? I know I'm going to embarrass myself. And so she's talking to herself that way. How would you talk to her?"} 
{"prompt": "I think that I'd probably express surprise, because I imagine that usually I don't perceive her as inarticulate or as embarrassing as she sees himself.", "completion": "OK. So you would be surprised and kind of reassuring to her, and say, oh, you don't seem that way."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And if you could be on her shoulder in the situation, what would you whisper in her ear?"} 
{"prompt": "Hmm.", "completion": "This is a good friend of yours. You want to be helpful."} 
{"prompt": " I would tell her to that, um, she's funny and charming and usually has really cool stories to tell, because she's had lots of good experiences.", "completion": "Hmm. So you'd be sitting on her shoulder saying things like, you are funny, and charming, and you have cool stories to tell. Hmm. What's it feel like when you imagine actually even saying those words to yourself in this kind of situation?"} 
{"prompt": "I mean, it sounds pretty ideal, but it sounds really far away from my current experience.", "completion": "It's not what you're whispering in your own ear."} 
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. What would stop you from actually doing this, from talking to yourself just like you would talk to a good friend? Because you're talking to yourself-you're kind of talking to yourself more like somebody who wanted to pull you down."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And so I just think, oh, what about that good friend? I mean, can you be a good friend to yourself in those moments and say something more supportive? You are a pretty successful in a variety of different things in your life. Right?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And so if you take one of those examples and you kind of break it down, are you able to-what do you do to prepare? Well, for example, even for a statistics test, I would guess that you have to go through some preparation."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Study.", "completion": "You study."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "OK. Kind of like studying-have you ever been in like a play or a dramatic performance of any type?"} 
{"prompt": "Oh, no. I avoid that.", "completion": " Totally. Not even like in grade school?"} 
{"prompt": "No. I think I maybe was in seventh grade.", "completion": "Yeah?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. But I had a very small part. I've always, like, my whole life, shied away from being the center of attention. It never feels good to me.", "completion": "No."} 
{"prompt": "Which is ironic, since I'm going to school to become a teacher.", "completion": " Yeah. So you have taught before and spoken in front of groups."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Small, medium."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "What do you do-"} 
{"prompt": "But it never feels.", "completion": "Well, it never feels comfortable, perfectly."} 
{"prompt": "No. Nuh uh. No. Yeah, I-", "completion": "So even right now, as we're talking. OK?"} 
{"prompt": "Uh huh.", "completion": "So I hear you say it never feels comfortable, right?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Would you put that thought in the category of helpful or unhelpful, to say that to yourself?"} 
{"prompt": "I'd say that's unhelpful.", "completion": "Unhelpful."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "OK. What's unhelpful about that thought?"} 
{"prompt": "Mmm. It kind of makes me feel like no matter how much I prepare, I still won't feel like I'm good enough or competent, or.", "completion": "Yeah, and just before that, you said I always shied away from attention. It's never felt good."} 
{"prompt": "It's some pretty black and white thinking.", "completion": "Well, that is pretty-yeah, good job noticing that."} 
{"prompt": " Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And I hear you saying that black and white thinking is maybe too general in that it doesn't provide any real hope for it ever changing."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And in that sense, it does seem like it fits in that unhelpful category."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. I mean, I definitely think like, you know, if you're nervous about something, to a certain extent, that's healthy, because it makes you prepare more. But at the same time, that kind of thinking of being like it will never get better, it will never be OK probably isn't that helpful.", "completion": "Yeah. Yeah. So I wonder if that's maybe as we think about the preparation stage, that that's one of the things that you said for a stats test you would study."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "I wonder if there's some way you could study this way that you have been thinking about yourself. I'm just not clever in a group. I'm just not comfortable. I've always shied away from that. I wonder if there would be different ways you could say things to yourself."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. For instance?", "completion": "For instance."} 
{"prompt": "There are times when I am comfortable in groups.", "completion": "There are times I am comfortable in groups. And that you probably would put into the more helpful thought category."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "So it seems like you've got this sort of a circle of thinking in there that takes you down into a negative place, that the embarrassment kind of starts this negative spiral. It takes you downward to-you're probably not consciously thinking I'll be alone and unhappy, but somehow it's related. People will think you're stupid. They won't want to be around you."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I feel like I, um-like not really on purpose, but I end up doing things to like, make myself not seen, like kind of invisible. And then usually I don't feel like that's as rewarding when I feel engaged and involved in a group.", "completion": "It kind of backfires, and you probably feel more lonely and unhappy based on withdrawing and being more invisible."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Definitely.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. And so you hold that belief of, if I do something embarrassing, it will go down that spiral. I'll be alone unhappy despite the fact that you told me just a couple minutes ago that you had a very embarrassing experience that now has added to your repertoire as a good storyteller. It's another story you can tell."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Yes.", "completion": "So you can see that I'm questioning the evidence, and I wonder if you are questioning it too, or if you're just thinking, I better go along with this for now."} 
{"prompt": "No. I definitely think that you're right. I just, like, hearing you say that I'm a good storyteller, that's so not my experience. I don't think I'm a good storyteller, so it's hard for me just to say, sure. But I agree with the evidence part.", "completion": "There is evidence that you have told some good stories."} 
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "You're not sure you would conclude that that therefore makes you a good storyteller."} 
{"prompt": "Exactly.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. So sometimes you are a good storyteller, and sometimes you're a less good storyteller."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And so I can hear it sounds like you're very careful about coming to any positive conclusions about yourself, but you're much less cautious-"} 
{"prompt":"", "completion": "You're much less cautious. You're more of a risk-taker when it comes to jumping to negative conclusions about yourself. Would you say that's-"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Yeah, I would say that's accurate.", "completion": "And so as we kind of head down sort of toward the end of our meeting today, I'm thinking about, well, what might be some useful things for you to try, experiment with, to see if it's helpful for you in coping with this situationally-based problem?"} 
{"prompt": "Hey.", "completion": "I'm wondering if we had a session today that was positive for you in that you were able to feel that we've accomplished something important to you. What would that look like?"} 
{"prompt": "There are a thousand things in my mind right now. I don't know which one I should say. Mmm.", "completion": "There are a lot of things that are important to you, and so it's hard to choose just one."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Mmm. Maybe let's start with my back pain, and then maybe we'll go somewhere.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. So one thing then, if we were to have a successful session, it would be important, it would mean something to you, that we might move in a positive direction regarding your back pain."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. OK. Yeah. Like in my brain, I always talk with myself. Though I'm not-it's not like I'm crazy or something, but it's like, when you don't have people around you, you usually talk with yourself.", "completion": "Right."} 
{"prompt": "So, yeah. I live by myself, and I usually talk, oh, I should do that while I'm doing that. So, like in my brain, I'm talking with myself, so.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. I should do that."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And yet it doesn't happen. And you know, Sidra, it's my job, because I think you've identified something that really does mean something to you."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And it's my job to kind of be a little pushy-"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "-and to have you focus on really what can you do? How do you-how do you, a very intelligent young woman, figure out a clear schedule to exercise in the ways that are going to make your back better?"} 
{"prompt": "Mmm. I'm should sleep on time in the night, wake up early morning, and then I can do that. Then I don't have that, excuse that I'm tired and I want to sleep or something.", "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "So I think that's the way I can do and organize the thing.", "completion": "So you think it's better to wake up early in the morning and-"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Yeah. So. But I'm a night person. That's the problem.", "completion": "Ah. So you like to stay up late and then sleep in."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. And then wake up like, 9:30ish. But if I have to go to work early morning, then 7:30 or 8:30.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "But waking up at like five every day,  it's so hard for me.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. So.", "completion": "So as you evaluate yourself, as you can look at your own behavior, you're pretty clear that you could do better with this."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Someday.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And so I'm all about trying to figure out, well, how do you do this better? And so getting to bed earlier, but, you're a night person."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Actually I improved a little bit. I was like really a night person-go to bed around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning. But now like 12:00 is like, maximum.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "So maybe if I just like, focus on that, I can do better and go to bed like at 10:00 or 11:00, so maybe then I can wake up a good morning actually.", "completion": "OK. So what do you think the odds are of you actually achieving that as you talk about it-changing yourself from being a night person to getting to bed at 10 or 11. What are the odds of that working out?"} 
{"prompt": "Mmm. [QUIETLY] I really hate it.", "completion": "I think you may be kind of tricking yourself with that particular solution."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Like, I want to sleep. It's like, OK, I should sleep now, because I have to wake up early morning. But something, like maybe my brain or heart or something, is saying, like, no, it's OK. You can do it. Oh, you have plenty of time, like five, six hours sleep is fine.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "So that's the thing. So it's like, OK, it's fine, I can just stay up until maybe 12 or 1:00.", "completion": "Or 1:00."} 
{"prompt": "And then I can sleep. And then in the week, like, I'm OK, but weekends. Oh. I just like, stay say up until 2:00, talk with friends or family. And so that just changed my schedule again, so.", "completion": "Well, yeah. It sounds like one of the hard things is that you really value the time late at night."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And so since you value it that much, it's hard for you just to say, I'm given that up. It means something to you."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And so it just doesn't seem right to say, ah, Sidra, stop that and go to bed at 11:00. And that hasn't worked very well for you in the past. You've tried that quite a lot. And so then I think to myself, well, maybe we should talk about what time during the day-let's say you stay up until midnight or 1:00, which is normal for you. You enjoy that."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "It's important to you. If you give yourself permission to do that, can you then organize your day to include the exercise that's going to make a difference?"} 
{"prompt": "Yes, I can. I mean, that I can come from work and like, done with the day, and then I can do my exercise or yoga. But then again, I was like, tired, time to watch TV, or maybe cooking time. It's just like, I just don't want to do that, so I maybe start cooking, though I'm super tired.", "completion": "So once a day for 30 minutes or 45 minutes?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Yeah.", "completion": "Which would be better for you?"} 
{"prompt": "Mmm, I think 45 minutes.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And so 45 minutes. And then how long does it take you to get ready to-I mean, if you get up at six and you were going to exercise for 45 minutes, would you be able to make it to work by 7:30?"} 
{"prompt": "Yes. It only takes me like 10, 15 minutes to get ready, so.", "completion": "Ah. So, you could get up at 6:30."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And still have time to exercise 45 minutes and get to work at 7:30? Or 6:15?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. It can be possible.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "So let's say 6:15."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And then what's going to get in the way of you getting up at 6:15?"} 
{"prompt": "Mmm, nothing. At that time, I'll be like, OK. Now I'm up. I can do that.", "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "The only thing is like leave my bed, and then, after that, I can do like all stuff. And then I'll be fine.", "completion": "Ah."} 
{"prompt": "The only thing is that.", "completion": "You are very creative. Tell me some ways you can get yourself out of bed."} 
{"prompt": "Well, we have a morning prayer, which should be-in summer, it's like, should be around like 5:00, 5:30. We have to do that. And in winter, it's like 8:30, because of the sun. If I promise myself that I have to wake up early morning to say my prayer on time, then I think I can do that.", "completion": "Do you do that? Do you get up in the morning and do your-"} 
{"prompt": "I'm not so good at it.", "completion": "Not all the time."} 
{"prompt": "Not all the time. But especially in Ramadan I can do that, so I always like, wake up for, for my breakfast kind of thing, so at that time, yeah. I can do that. Like in Ramadan, I'm really organized.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "So it should be like Ramadan whole year, I think.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "So.", "completion": "Huh. And because that's very important to you-the Ramadan celebration."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And the prorcess."} 
{"prompt": "And the fasting and everything, yeah.", "completion": "The fasting. OK. Hmm. What is it about that that gets you out of bed to do the morning prayers?"} 
{"prompt": "I don't know. I It's kind of like, passion I would say. Like, oh, I have to do that, because it's a really important thing, and I want to make God happy, and I have to. It's kind of like that. So.", "completion": "So you develop during that time of year some passion and commitment and desire to make God happy, and so then you get yourself up."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Yeah.", "completion": "Pretty much always?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. Yeah, always.", "completion": "At the end of this segment, John is very persistent in his confrontations of Sidra.", "completion": "Right. And I think it's important to think about how the confrontations are framed.", "completion": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "It's not like I'm harshly confronting her because of something I think she should do.", "completion": "Right.", "completion": "Now Sidra, a couple of things about the kind of counseling or therapy that we're doing. One is that, as it turns out, there are some things you have control over, and some things you have less control over. Would you say that that seems true?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "So I'm going to just draw a little picture here on my clipboard that illustrates what you do have more control over and less control over."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "And so I'm not a very good drawer, and so I want you to, I guess, have patience with my drawing ability."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "But I'm drawing four wheels here."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And then I'm going to put a car on it. So it's sort of like we're looking at a car from up in the air."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And there's the steering wheel of a car, and there's an engine. OK. And according to this perspective, there are what they call front wheel behaviors and rear wheel behaviors."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And so the front wheel behaviors are your thoughts."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "And your actions. OK."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Those are things that you more or less have control over."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "So, for example, when you said you lie in bed and you think, oh, maybe I don't need to get up and exercise. That's an example of your thoughts, and you're aware of them, and you know you can change them sometimes, right?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "They're kind of hard and tricky to change, but you can."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And actions-the actual getting up. You got up and you got here."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Right?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "I mean, that's an example. You have some control over that. Again, we're all human. We don't have perfect control over those things, but we have quite a bit of control."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And back here, we have feelings and we have physiology."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And the feelings are like, anger, sadness-emotions. And the physiology-in your case, the physiology is really important, because you have said that your back pain is one thing that is important to you to change."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "It's a rear wheel behavior in that if you direct your actions and your thoughts points toward the goal of a healthy back, right, because that's important to you now and in the future-"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "The physiology will follow."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Just like a car, right? I mean, you turn the front wheels."} 
{"prompt": "The back wheels follow.", "completion": "The back wheels follow."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Exactly. And so what we really want to do in our time together, and what we've done a bit of already is to focus on your thoughts, focus on your actions, and to be very specific about the thoughts and the actions that lead you towards a healthy back."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "And then, and this might be one of the most important things of all, is to make a really good plan for how you can control those thoughts and actions to the best of your ability, to lead the physiology, the back pain, in the right direction."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Does that make sense to you?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. It does.", "completion": "So when we think about the back pain, what thoughts and actions do you think of as being most important to take you toward that healthy back goal?"} 
{"prompt": "Just be careful, as I am right now. But I would say my back really needs care, and I should be gentle with that. Like if I'm sitting, I should sit like straight, rather than to be like this or something. Or with a back-I should have like, some support. And also doing yoga. And, eat healthy.", "completion": "OK. So be careful in that make sure that your posture is good."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Maybe-you mentioned earlier about not lifting something too heavy."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Yeah.", "completion": "Those kinds of things."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And then eat healthy and do yoga. Those three-"} 
{"prompt": "Three things. Or maybe also, I'm kind of like a person-if I start something, I just really want to finish that thing, like right away. I have no tolerance, I would say-bad thing. So maybe I should start focusing on that. So if I start something, I can do it tomorrow. So just not like be hard on myself when I I want to do that.", "completion": "Yeah. Somehow what I'm hearing there is that that's maybe more the thoughts."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Obviously these are actions. Be careful, eat healthy, do yoga."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And then the thoughts are, this is really important to me."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "I want a healthy back. I want to be away from pain."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "What I'm doing right now is I'm thinking, how do we make this even a better plan? How do we make it so that-and I like the idea of doubling or tripling up the important things to you, prayer, exercise, breakfast. But then I think, are there other things that can make it even more strong of a pull for you to accomplish these things? And you're saying no, and I'm continuing to sort of think, hmm."} 
{"prompt": "Maybe.", "completion": "Maybe. I just think, well, what makes it easier to exercise? What makes it more motivating, simpler? And when you exercise, are you doing yoga?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Is that right? Do you do a routine, specific exercises?"} 
{"prompt": "Specific, just for my back. I cannot do like all of those, otherwise it will start hurting me.", "completion": "Right. So you have a set of yoga exercises. And you do them in the same order each time?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And are they written down or are they in a book or on a video or-"} 
{"prompt": "It was on a video, but now I remember them, how to do that. So I don't need the video.", "completion": "You don't need the video anymore."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": " Do you like the video?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Yeah?"} 
{"prompt": "It was fun.", "completion": "Does that make it more likely to happen or less likely to happen, if you've got the video in the video machine and ready to roll at 6:00. Well, when you go to bed, it's sitting there right ready. Does that make it easier or harder?"} 
{"prompt": "Think so, easy.", "completion": "Maybe?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "So the video sitting out or in the machine might actually help, too."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. I think so.", "completion": "OK. And that's kind of what we're looking at right now, is what makes it more likely to happen? What makes it less likely to happen? Even the tiny little details of setting-I don't know if it's a video or a DVD or whatever it is. But would it be better if it was in the machine or sitting out so you can see it?"} 
{"prompt": "I think in the machine. I can just play.", "completion": "Yeah. Just push Play and start."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "OK. When would you put it in the machine? You can I'm a very picky-"} 
{"prompt": " I can do it today.", "completion": "You could go home and put it in the machine so that it's ready to roll."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. And put the cover on the table so I know something is in the machine. So I have to do that.", "completion": "Yeah. Here's a really funny question for you."} 
{"prompt": "Uh huh.", "completion": "How will you remember from this moment to when you get home that you want to put the yoga video?"} 
{"prompt": "My memory's so good.", "completion": "You will not forget that?"} 
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "I never forget things, it's just like, I don't want to do that.", "completion": " So you might get home and say, I don't want to do that, but you will remember it."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Yeah, my memory's so good.", "completion": "How will you get yourself home and say, I want to do that?"} 
{"prompt": "I have an excuse. I have to go work right after that.  But yeah, when I will be back, then I can do that.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And how do you get yourself-you will remember, you'll get home from work, and you will remember."} 
{"prompt": "I know I'm going to do that for sure today, because we are talking too much about that thing. I know I am doing that today.", "completion": "So in some ways, this will help with the motivation."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Is it maybe we have an arrangement? I mean, we have an agreement that you will do that?"} 
{"prompt": "They never say that, but it just seems that way. Because like, my parents were married right after high school, and my mom has three kids and my dad has three kids, but they're divorced now. And so not the same three.", "completion": "Right. Right."} 
{"prompt": "But, and my brother lives right next door to my mom, with his partner, and they just had a baby. And my sister lives at home still, even though she's in college. But she still lives at home. And my other sister's in high school. And they all-my grandmother even lives with my mom, so it's like, multi-generational right there. Like, my grandmother, my mom, my brother, and my sister were all right there. And my parents always ask me, and my grandparents too, like, when are you coming home and when are you going to start your career? And so it kind of seems to me like-I went away for a while, and now it's like, maybe it's time to come home and start a career and a family. And so I just feel like I want those things, and part of me wants them right now, but I also, like, really want to pursue this, so.", "completion": "So one of the strategies you use to figure out what it was they wanted and to communicate to them that they mattered was sort of to take the time to consult with each one, it sounds like."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Yeah, and that was really, really huge for me, especially my brother, because he just had a baby. And I just felt like I needed to be there for that like, season of his life. And when I talked to him and he, like, really understood. And he said like if he were me then he would go. But I mean, he's not at all interested in going to another country.", "completion": "Right."} 
{"prompt": "But knowing me and like hearing me talk about it, he can hear that I really should go. But he knows that I, like, really love him and want to be there and love his daughter and like, want to be there for her. And so me hearing him say that and believing that he really means it, that was probably like the most important part.", "completion": "Piece of all of it. Yeah. So I have to ask you one question that I think I probably know the answer to. But when you did this consultation round, how did to incorporate prompt? Did you have a consultation time with yourself?"} 
{"prompt": " I don't know. I mean, I guess I kind of did all along. When-I mean, especially like when I talked it through with my mom, and the more I talked about it, the more I realized that I really believed the things that I was saying. And I got like, more excited about, you know, like the things I want to study-like learning about trauma reconciliation in Ugan-in Rwanda. I'm not going to Uganda. And how that is going to like, apply to things I want to learn later, and maybe like continue my studies after the Peace Corps. And I just got like, more and more excited about it. And so that was kind of a confirmation to me that it's something I really, really do want to do.", "completion": "How was your mom-were you convincing her, or was she coming along with you on that? What was the relationship conversation like?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. I think I was convincing her. And I remember at the end of it she was like, wow, I've never heard you say-I've never heard that before. I didn't know that this was something that you were so interested in. And I'm really proud of you,  which was a big-probably the biggest part of it. Like, I felt like she really heard me, which hasn't always happened or doesn't always happen in our relationship, even though I had to like, stop her from interrupting me a few times and like, redirect the conversation back to me.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "And then to hear just like, get it, and say that she's proud of me and that she's excited for me instead of, well, I just wish you'd come home.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "So.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "I don't know if that answers the question, but that's-", "completion": "Yeah, kind of. Because I think when we were talking before, you weren't so sure you would have family support. In fact, I think that was one of the biggest burdens in making the decision."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Besides just the sheer-terror may be too strong a word, but definitely a fear about missing out on life's developmental pieces that were really valuable to you. That was this other piece with the families voices, like, come home, prompt. It's time. You've had enough fun out there."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And then, so when you checked in with them, it wasn't quite that unanimous."} 
{"prompt": "Right. I mean, of course they want me to be near them, and they don't understand why I would want to leave Georgia ever. But they like, really want me to be happy and successful and fulfilled, and so they want that more than they want me close to them. And so-and I guess I kind of-maybe I like, hopefully knew that. Like I hoped that would be the case. But to hear them say that, each of them say that, was really good. But also I kind of said, you know, if I don't like it, I can come home. And so knowing that it's not like a permanent forever commitment, you know, makes it a little bit easier for everyone, myself included.", "completion": "So you had permission to give it a try from them. And I'm hearing indirectly that you sorted it out by talking to them. But I still want to come back to that question about how do you check in with just prompt? Is there some way you do that after you've had those conversations?"} 
{"prompt": "I mean, I do like a little bit of journaling, and a lot of praying. And like sometimes I'll just take a walk, and just like be.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "So I guess that is checking in with myself. But I don't- like, I would probably go crazy if I like, sat down and thought, OK, what do you want to do?", "completion": " Right."} 
{"prompt": "I don't make like, pros and cons lists, really. It's more like I feel like I just like start to feel OK about things. And then I know it's the right or-yeah, the right thing to do.", "completion": "Yeah. So if you were going to name the most positive role model in your life right now, who would it be?"} 
{"prompt": "The most positive role model.  That's like here with-", "completion": "It could be anywhere, or a combination of pieces of role modeling that you've picked up along the way that you really like how that person is or you would like to be like them."} 
{"prompt": "I don't know.  Maybe like, Nancy,  like my teachers here. I think because-well, like, one thing that I really like about Nancy, um, is that she is like, super, super smart, but she's a learner. So like, she is really competent in what she knos, but also like, realizes that she doesn't know everything and is like really interested to hear from people and to like, to learn-and like to add to her own experience. And so that's something that I really want to be. And sometimes maybe I do that too much. Like, I want people to tell me what I should know  and what I should believe and what I should do. But-", "completion": "You like that value of her willingness to let in other opinions and learn new things, and also she's really smart and you like that."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah, and really confident about her own ideas and beliefs, which I would like to have more.", "completion": "Yeah. That's the piece I was thinking might be the role model piece, like, OK, here's this really smart woman who isn't afraid to take in new information. But, she's also pretty confident about what she does know and who she is."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And that's what I see you moving toward as you sort out the different voices in your life and-"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Yeah.", "completion": "Rita, in that previous segment, I noticed that you asked prompt if she took time and how she consulted with herself.", "completion": "Yeah. You know, prompt is caught in the very traditional problem that many females find themselves, which is an expectation they will check in on everybody else's opinions and everyone else's needs, and they will do that first, and sometimes foremost.", "completion": "Right. And so feminist therapy is focusing on how prompt can find her voice and find her place in the world.", "completion": "Yep I have to struggle a little bit with prompt to bring her back to a place where she can look at how she can find her way without feeling guilty or burdened by other people's expectations.", "completion": "That's a big challenge.", "completion": "Yes it is.", "completion": "And so let's see how it goes.", "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "Pretend like I'm not really saying goodbye?  is because I'll probably-I mean, I'm sure I'll see them again. And I'm sure I'll stay in touch. And I don't like making a big deal out of it, because it makes a big deal out of me.  And I don't really like that.", "completion": "It makes a big deal out of you."} 
{"prompt": "No, like, I just-I'm obviously really emotional, and so I don't like saying goodbye over and over and over again, and like-", "completion": "So denial kind of works for you."} 
{"prompt": "It's hard. It's just hard enough.", "completion": "Yeah. So you're trying to find ways to make it not quite so repeatedly difficult and sad."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. I'd rather like take the memories that I have and take the meaning that I have from those memories, and say, see you later, instead of like, sit down with every person and tell them why they're so important to me and how much I'm going to miss them and list the things I'm going to miss. You know? I'd rather just go than do that.", "completion": "So can I check on just one little piece of that that I heard? And you know, it could be-you know, I don't even like Freud, but it could be a Freudian thing that I heard, where you said it doesn't make a big deal out of me. And I know it was just expression, but the reciprocal of that process, if you did go sit down with each person that you're imagining and you said, oh, Nancy, thank you so much for everything you've meant to me. And then it's pretty predictable that Nancy would say back to you, oh, prompt, you were awesome. Thank you for the ways you took the leadership. Thank you for the ways that you were so emotionally available in class, and-"} 
{"prompt": "", "completion": "Right?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And I'm guessing that it'd be hard saying those things and taking the time, but it would even be harder to sit there and hear back how much people care about you and your strengths."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Like just yesterday, I say goodbye to the family that I've been nannying for. And I kind of wanted it to be like a, well, it's been-it's been good.  I'll see ya. And then like, later I would send a thank you card or send a card like writing out how much they mean to me. But the mom, Andrea, like sat down and just told me like how important it is to have someone who she really trusts to take care of her kids, are like, how big of a deal. And I know that's a huge deal. And, I wanted to, you know, thank her for like, trusting me with the most important thing in her life. But, I just like, it was really hard to like, sit there. I didn't want to cry and like, get all involved in the moment. And it was hard to hear her like tell me that, basically, you know, that they love me. And it was just hard to hear that.", "completion": "Yeah. What do you think that's about? Why is that hard?"} 
{"prompt": "I don't know. Because I don't-I feel like I don't want to leave. Like, if I'm such a good thing in their life, I feel like a jerk for leaving. So it would just be easier if we could, you know, say goodbye, and then maybe I'll come back.", "completion": "But not to know how you significant you were because somehow there's a message that comes with that that you shouldn't take yourself away because you're important and helpful to these people, and they love you, and that's such a hard message in our culture. And I can't tell you how many women I know who feel like they should clone themselves into at least four, because these people at their church tell them how much they matter and they need to be over there, and their family needs them, and then they're really good at their work."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And then they're in a reading group, and the group just wants more time with them. And how do you be a wonderful person who everyone wants more of and not go around feeling guilty all the time?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. I don't know. I wish I did. Because now that like I'm talking about it and you're pointing it out, I can see like, it was so hard for me to leave Kenya and come here-so hard. And when I think of why it was so hard, I think of like the high school girls that I spent a lot of time with, and they were like, who are we going to talk to now? What are we going to do without you? I just love you a lot and I'm really grateful for you, but I heard, I'm not going to have any friends. I'm not going to have you anymore.", "completion": "Right."} 
{"prompt": "And then every time I leave like, my family, it's because I feel like my brother needs me, and my little sisters need me. And I know my mom needs me. And yeah, I guess that's one of the reasons why it's so hard.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "And why I don't like for people to tell me how much they love me, because it translates to I need you.", "completion": "I need you."} 
{"prompt": "And I feel bad for not being there.", "completion": "Yeah. So love can feel like a big burden in a weird way."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. And then I feel bad for thinking that.", "completion": " You just can't get away from it, no matter-yeah. But sorting that out is-to me, one of the big jobs of adulthood is-I stumbled into this concept when I was working with people with disabilities, and it was called interdependence. Because I think in our culture we either idolize independence-a rough, rugged individual, nobody needs them, they don't need anybody-or dependence, which is child-like. And, you know, there's no model for how to be in the middle and to admit that sometimes you need people and sometimes you need to stand on your own individual two feet or whatever. And I think sometimes the burden of being a lovable, capable person is really hard because you have to be the one that decides where the energy goes and where the helping goes."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And then people are mad when you take it away, kind of. So love can even be expressed in a kind of mean way, like, I really love you, do not leave me. Come back and take care of me."} 
{"prompt": " Yeah.", "completion": "So the hard message of someone who loves someone saying that is, oh, I am so sorry. I love you, too. And I believe in you. And I think you can find some new ways to meet your needs, because I'm going to be moving on over here. But I still love you. And I still love that you love me. Does that make sense?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. It totally does.", "completion": "It felt like that was a little sermon, there, but."} 
{"prompt": "No, it totally does. And that I'm realizing that I thought that I was carrying this burden of being so needed, and now I'm like, oh, it's kind of arrogant to think that I'm so-that people like, need me so badly.", "completion": "Yeah. I had a little bit that same feeling when I was in India, like, oh, what-you know? But it was also this is freeing thing, like, oh, OK. It's a little embarrassing, like you said. But it's also kind of freeing. Like,t hen the job becomes to figure out who you are. Do what you need to do with your life."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "Does that feel like a burden or a happy thing or-"} 
{"prompt": "A good thing.", "completion": "Yeah?"} 
{"prompt": "Freedom is always a good thing.", "completion": "Mmm, you don't sound really convinced."} 
{"prompt": " Well, because I'm thinking that sometimes it's hard, because then you have to like, really look at yourself and figure out who you are and what you want to be, or who you want to be.", "completion": "I know. I know."} 
{"prompt": "But-but, yeah. It's a good thing.", "completion": " Well, that's something we can talk about in our next session too, if you want."} 
{"prompt": "Hmm", "completion": "It may have to be after Rwanda."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. It will.", "completion": "Yeah."}
{"prompt": "Hey", "completion": "So I just want to hear from you first. So after our session, what would-how would we know that we had a good session?"} 
{"prompt": "If I could-I'd like to if not have my decision made, but I'd like to have a clear idea of how I can make my decision. That would be ideal.", "completion": "And so what kind of decision are we talking about here."} 
{"prompt": "I need to decide between two schools for next year, going to college.", "completion": "All right. So you mentioned feeling guilty about making a choice to go to Richmond, which is really expensive, and you're wondering if it's worth the money. So let's say on a scale of one to 10, and one being like, no guilt at all. You feel really comfortable. And then 10 being like, gut-wrenching guilt. You just, it's paralyzing. You can't imagine doing it. About where would you say on that scale are you at right now?"} 
{"prompt": "So, like a seven and a half.", "completion": "Seven and a half. And tell me about that guilt feeling."} 
{"prompt": "Well, I just feel like I'm closing doors for other people, and I feel like I'm being really super, super selfish. And I know it's for, like, a better future for me, but I don't want to like affect anyone else in my decision. And I'm going to, and I don't like that feeling at all. I hate feeling like I'm causing problems or like there's even a wake in what my decision is.", "completion": "OK. So how could we move that just down a little bit to, let's say, a six. How could we reduce some of that guilt feeling?"} 
{"prompt": "Well, I'd like to work something out with my parents.", "completion": "OK. Tell me some more about that."} 
{"prompt": "If I could-well, I'd like to take the weight off their shoulders. And if I could get scholarships or student loans. But then that closes doors possibly in my future. And I'd like to be able to pay for some of college-a lot of it.", "completion": "OK. So what are some possibilities? You said you can pay for some of college, you could get some more scholarships."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "How could you do that?"} 
{"prompt": "Well, I don't know if I can get scholarships this year, because it's pretty late in the year. But next year, when I'm a sophomore, I can hopefully apply for work-based scholarships. And I plan on doing that, because I don't want to be a burden for my parents at all. And I'd like to apply for student loans under my name, and not my parents'.", , C"completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "So I'd like to-and that would make me feel better.", "completion": "So you've got a couple ideas. You're going to apply for some more scholarships when you're there, because there's usually department scholarships, and you'll learn about other opportunities while you're on campus. Because it sounds like you're not getting very much financial aid this first year."} 
{"prompt": "Nuh uh.", "completion": "And I heard about your sister, who's going to school in a couple of years, so maybe by then-you know, when you have two kids in college, that increases your needs, so that might qualify you for some more loans and scholarships."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "OK. So let's take that even further. How could we get it down to a five or maybe a four? How can we really relieve that guilt feeling so where you feel really good about your decision?"} 
{"prompt": "Well, I'd probably need to get a job and help pay for some of it.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "And if I could do that, it would be really helpful. But I'm worried because my parents don't want me to get a job, because they've always said that schooling is my job and doing well in school is my job. So I feel like I'm battling against that on two fronts. Because I want to take the weight off their shoulders, but then at the same time, they're like, barring me from doing that.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "So if I could get a job and save up a little bit, like even if I could just pay for my books, I would feel so much better, because it's just that little extra expense taken away.", "completion": "OK. And so finding a job-maybe work study or summer work."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "But then you're still nervous about the school work, because you're supposed to be there as a student."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "And so that's causing also you a little bit of anxiety."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. I'm nervous for the workload in school, because I just don't know if I can handle it with my learning disability. And I don't know what options I have there for help.", "completion": "OK. And tell me a little bit more about your learning disability."} 
{"prompt": "Well, in high school it's been easy, because I'm offered so much accommodations and teachers are really forgiving. But I don't know if that'll be the same in school. And I don't want to get there and not be able to handle the work because it's above my level of comprehension. And that's a very real possibility, and if I flunk a class, my parents would not be paying for college anymore at all.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. OK. And so you managed to get through high school, or you did a great job of getting through high school with some help. And it sounds like you're nervous about the workload coming up for college, which is now kind of tied in with feelings of guilt that you-I'm not sure that this is a good choice, because it's a competitive school, and that's tied in with some anxiety about your ability to do the work."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "But what have you done in the past when you've had those feelings, because I'm sure those have come up before?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. I mean like coming in to high school, I didn't think I could handle what was going on at all. And I didn't, sometimes. Sometimes I was really not a good student. But then I had to like, kick it double into gear to get back.", "completion": "Yeah. Tell me about those times when you felt like you were a really good student. Like, yes. I'm doing it really well."} 
{"prompt": "Well, it helped that I liked my classes.", "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "Like, this year, for example, AP Gov is the hardest class I have ever taken, but I love it. It's so interesting. And then I do the work because I want to do it, because I like it. But then when there's classes that I don't like, like all of my math class that they're hard for me because the dyslexia makes it really hard to do the math. And I just don't find it interesting, so I don't do well in them.", "completion": "Right. So picking classes that you really like and you feel excited about."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "So and one of the great things about college is that you have lots of choices."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Right? And there's all kinds of opportunities that you have never seen before, right?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Anthropology classes and gender studies."} 
{"prompt": "History of Rock and Roll.", "completion": "The History of Rock and Roll. Right. Classes that we don't offer here in high school. And so that sounds like that might alleviate some of your anxieties-finding a place or finding classes that you really, really enjoy."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. And then I can do well in them. And I think that would help me like, feel like I was getting my money's worth if I was proving-like, doing well in these classes, and then therefore proving that this is where I should be. But I don't even know if I can do that.", "completion": "And again, tell me some times where you felt like a good student, So something that you enjoyed. And what about doing the homework part, or where you got excited about doing the homework or doing a project. What were some other times where you had those kind of feelings?"} 
{"prompt": "It helped when I had good teachers who understood where I was coming from and why sometimes things were more difficult for me. And I never-I tried not to like, have anything handed to me, because that's not fair. Just because I'm dyslexic doesn't mean I deserve tons of special treatment.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "But it helps when I had teachers who could help me help myself.", "completion": "Yeah. So part of having a good class is also having a good teacher. And again, what a great opportunity in college, because the professors are available with office hours."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And you can meet them before signing up for their class."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And so it seems like there's a way to find out who your good teachers are, or that you connect with initially."} 
{"prompt": "And I know there's good opportunity to, like, connect with program for people with learning disabilities at Richmond. So I hopefully won't have to take many math classes.", "completion": "OK. So we've identified a couple things that you can do that make you feel good as a student. And does that help with-you know, again, on the scale from 1 to 10, where are we at now with some of these ideas?"} 
{"prompt": "Well, if I'm able to do well and feel like I'm working hard enough where I deserve to have my parents pay for it, then I guess it's like a 4.5.", "completion": "Yeah? We've reduced it a little bit?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "That's great. So you feel a little bit calmer."} 
{"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "And let's go a little further."} 
{"prompt": "OK.", "completion": "How would we get it down-could we get it down to two or three?"} 
{"prompt": "I hope so.  I think if-", "completion": "Of the things that you said in high school that was helpful is that you felt like you got a lot of support and some help. And I'm just guessing here, and you tell me. Is there some worry or some feelings about not being able to find or create a support system?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "You're going to be halfway across the country."} 
{"prompt": "And-", "completion": "On your own. New people who don't know you."} 
{"prompt": "And new systems that won't-I don't know if it will help benefit me.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "Oh, that scares me so much.  I'm so nervous. In both schools. Like, it's the East Coast. They're different than what I'm used to here, and I don't know if-I don't know. I feel like I'm going to a different country sometimes.", "completion": "Yeah. Would it be accurate all to say kind of like when you walk on stage and there's, um, there's a new audience who you don't know and you've got to kind of convince them that this is a good show?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Is it at all like that?"} 
{"prompt": "Like doing play teasers when all the school kids come and watch, and they just, you have to like convince them in the first 30 seconds that they're going to like the show, or-", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "And you can lose your audience, and that's a bad feeling.", "completion": "Right. And so you've kind of been in that situation before."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "How did you handle it then?"} 
{"prompt": "Knowing what was going on and taking control of the situation.", "completion": "OK."} 
{"prompt": "And helping on-well, when you're on stage, you have to help the other actors around you and support them while doing your job acting.", "completion": "OK. So you said that you can kind of take control of the situation a little bit, and you said you kind of help the other actors, as well. How could you kind of control the situation when you walk into this new environment called college?"} 
{"prompt": "I think they need to ask for help, and not-like, while I want to be able to do this on my own, I don't know if I'm-I don't have all the information yet, and I need to swallow my pride and admit that I'm going to need a lot of help, and frequently, and make friends with career counselors, and-", "completion": "Yeah. And who are the people that can help?"} 
{"prompt": "Well, I know that there's career counseling and there's tutoring that you can get into, and hopefully I'll make friends.  And the admissions counselors. I like my admissions counselor a lot. She's really nice. So I need to find friends-not necessarily friends, but people who can help me, and find those fast, and be goal one when I get there.", "completion": "There are people knocking on your door and they just want to do all kinds of things with you, and that you've got all kinds of friends, and you're really popular."} 
{"prompt": " I could deal with that. That'd be OK with me.", "completion": "Yeah. How does that-yeah. How does that help with kind of this anxiety about making friends?"} 
{"prompt": "Well, that-that would be so much easier. I would feel so much better if I like had a built-in system of people I can like automatically study with.", "completion": "Yeah, so I hear-so there is a fair amount of anxiety around this."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Where you're nervous about kind of being by yourself, and you're having to create kind of the environment or the situation that you have here that's helped you so much over the years."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. And I'm just nervous that coming from different parts of the country, like, at least in the culture I've grown up with, it's so open and friendly. And I'm nervous I'm going to go to a place where they're a little more cold and a little more reserved, and not so willing to be open to friendships. And I just don't how to act around people who are more reserved.", "completion": "And so you're a little nervous about kind of going to the East Coast, where it might feel a little bit different than where you're comfortable with."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. And I don't want to go out there and be like a-I'm nervous to scare people off by coming into school and being like, this is me. I'm Tesla, I'm from Montana, and blah. And like, be overbearing to people. That's what I'm afraid that I'll do.", "completion": "But could you also see that as a really positive thing? Where you are so different, and coming from the Wild West, that people would be really open to that and it would be kind of refreshing because you're different than kind of what you perceive as the East Coast?"} 
{"prompt": "I never thought about that. I'd like that if that was how it was, and-because that would help with like being-I don't want to like, initiate the friendships. I want to have them more open and free- flowing. And if like people are interested in me, that would make me feel better.", "completion": "Yeah. Because I hear you saying it a little bit as if it's not a strength, that it's kind of a negative to be from Montana."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "But what if it were a positive, and that part of the reason you were there, at school, was to show people another way of being, another part of the country, to share your experiences."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And that that is part of other people's education, too, which is why colleges want geographic diversity."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Is that it brings in interesting ideas and different personalities. And-"} 
{"prompt": "And it gives me a conversation starter.", "completion": "A conversation starter. Yeah. So what would it be like, then, to go into the conversations or into these interactions thinking, huh, I have something to offer these people."} 
{"prompt": " Well, I'd first have to become cocky, and I'm not cocky. So. But if I was, I could make some jokes about how we don't use outhouses in Montana. And then I could be-I can make people laugh, and I'd like to be able to do that. And I feel like that would help me a lot by attracting friends if I can get them laughing first without making a fool of myself, because that's when people get annoyed with you, if you're too boisterous.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. And so I hear you're saying that you're nervous about meeting people, but you're outgoing. Right? You said that you like to make people laugh."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And you have lots of these different interests. Tell me some more about the things that you like about yourself."} 
{"prompt": "Oh, that's hard.", "completion": "That are interesting. That kind of make up who you are."} 
{"prompt": "Well, I'm really, really good about caring about people. I have a lot of love that I can spew at people. I have really intense motherly instincts. And, I mean, I like that about myself, I guess-being able to like, care for people. And I'm a good listener,  I guess.", "completion": "Yeah? And tell me about what it looks like when you care for the people."} 
{"prompt": "It's not a about listening-or about me, it's about like, what I need to do for the other person, and that's the most important thing sometimes, is being able to care for other people, even when you're not feeling so great yourself.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "But I feel like that's a deeper part of relationships, and I don't know how to show that to people when I first meet them.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. Yeah, that takes some time to establish some trust, and-but what I hear you saying too is that it's easier for you to take care of other people, and not necessarily take care of yourself or do what feels good for you, because that feels guilty and selfish."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "So we're kind of coming around to kind of what brought you here-feeling this guilt that, this is what I want to do, but I don't feel so good about that."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. They're all connected a little bit, and,  well, I don't know. I just don't want to be selfish in any of it, because I really just despise selfishness in people.", "completion": "I hear you."}
