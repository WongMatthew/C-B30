{"prompt": "Hey.", "completion": "Where do you want to go with this session? What do you feel like you could benefit most from talking about this section?"} 
{"prompt": "Well, you know that picture of the big jar and-it's Stephen Covey, I think. And you fill it with the big rocks, and then you say, is the jar full? And then say, oh, yes, the jar is full. And then he says, well, no, wait. Look, you can put all this gravel-", "completion": "Gravel in."} 
{"prompt": "-in it. Yeah.", "completion": "Yes."} 
{"prompt": "And then is it full? Oh, yeah, well, no. You can put the sand in and then put water in it. And then what's the lesson? And the people always think the lesson is you can always get more in the jar. But the lesson is, really, that those big rocks have to go in first. So I've been thinking about that a lot-to know what the big rocks are and make sure they're in the jar. And so my family, and work, and school, and my spiritual life are all in the jar. And I guess I would say that in these last few weeks, I just feel like those four rocks are jockeying for position-", "completion": "In the jar."} 
{"prompt": "-in the jar, yeah.", "completion": "OK. They're jockeying for position in that jar. But they all fit in the jar."} 
{"prompt": "They're in the jar, right.", "completion": "They're in the jar and they fit."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "So tell me what position do they need to be in in that jar?"} 
{"prompt": "Well-", "completion": "What do they-"} 
{"prompt": "I actually would like to throw the work rock out of the jar.", "completion": "Oh, really?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. I feel just-I feel frustrated at work, like it's just, I'm in the wrong place. It's taking up too much time for the amount of reward. All of the reward is just financial, and I am ready to say-you know, they always say follow your passion. And the money, well-", "completion": "Yes. Money is not your passion."} 
{"prompt": "And that seems completely unrealistic, especially toward the end of life, when you're supposed to be thinking of putting stuff away. But when I think, so I should just do this for another 10 years and retire, it just makes me feel like screaming and tearing out my hair. I can't do it.", "completion": "Wow."} 
{"prompt": "I physically can't do it. I have to do something else.", "completion": "Something different has to come."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. It takes such a big chunk of life. You know, I'd like to say-in fact, I do say to my husband-why don't you just think about this and see how you feel? And I actually do think that will be part of the process, when he just says, you know, I just feel like you need to do this. And he hasn't said that yet. I mean, he's asked me if I think this is just an expensive hobby-", "completion": "School?"} 
{"prompt": "-which-yeah.", "completion": "Isn't that interesting."} 
{"prompt": "For a while, I could sort of agree with him. It sort of is. I'm just doing it for fun. But the more I'm in the program, the more I sort of like fish or cut bait. You're either going to be invested in it, or else you're just, you know, like-I don't know. You just wanted a diploma on your wall. That would be an expensive hobby.", "completion": "It would be an expensive hobby, but school is one of the rocks."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And it sounds like it incorporates some of that spiritual part."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. And my family.", "completion": "And the work, and family and work."} 
{"prompt": "Right. It's bringing me together with my son, and my husband always just says, I know you were born to go to school. So even if it's an expensive hobby, he wants to be able to provide that for me.", "completion": "Yes. And I think born to go to school is one thing, but born to be in the program you're in-"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "That's different, isn't it?"} 
{"prompt": "It's taken a while to grow that.", "completion": "Isn't that different?"} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm. I can't-well, it's so many years when I didn't feel like a grown up. I remember being at my daughter's volleyball game when she was in junior high, and during a break the coach came over and was talking to some of us sitting on the bleachers. And in the middle of this conversation-which is always kind of difficult for me. I never can think of what to say. And I thought, ahh, he thinks I'm a grown-up. It was like, . Because I was a mom of a teenage kid, but inside, uh, no. That just wasn't going to go.", "completion": "Well, OK. It begs the question-tell me what being a grown- up means to you then. What is that? What is grown-up?"} 
{"prompt": "Well, just that sense, I guess, that you could to make decisions about your own life, that you weren't just waiting for people to tell you what came next. And then you would go, OK. Although, I mean, even as I say that, I know with the kids that I just really like, give me those kids.  And that was kind of primal and just in my bones.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "But in every other area, it was really like, ah-that sense of not being able to ask for things. That was always pretty strong. In fact, it just seems like recently, since I've been coming to counseling, that I've had that feeling like, boy, I could ask for things that I want. And I think even in kind of little practical ways, like, to say, you know, I know you feel on uneasy around my kids, but do you think you could just come stay with them for an afternoon? Even something like that, where, nah, I don't want to do that. And so somethings that I really want-like this. I really, really want to go to school. And I am actually saying to my husband, I really want to do this. And he-and my son, too. They go, are you sure? Do you really see yourself doing this? Because it was sort of be pushing out into where I haven't really been before. But I've done some training with parents-had groups for foster and adoptive parents. But to actually be a professional person, ahh, that's sometimes you have to stop thinking that you would just be play-acting and think-it's like applying to the program, where you think, they'll never take me. That's ridiculous. And then going, well, why wouldn't they? And the next thing is to say-you'll never make it in the professional world, and to start saying, well, why not? Why wouldn't I?", "completion": "That questioner. There's always that question of there. And it's not just a questioner-kind of a doubter."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "There's always a doubter there. OK."} 
{"prompt": "Always have to prove something.", "completion": "OK. Is that the grown-up you or the not grown-up you?"} 
{"prompt": "I think it's the baby me that says, too scary. Too hard. The gifted child me that I learned pretty quick-well, maybe not quick enough, but certainly by sixth grade-if you stand out, if you excel, if you put your head up where people can see you, somebody is going to chop that off. They're going to send you to the principal's office every day during art so that you can learn to type, or they're going to push you out of this grade into the next grade to leave all your friends behind and meet a lot of people who think you have no business being there, or whatever that thing is. Don't stick out. And so it just makes you kind of want to not rock the boat.", "completion": "So I'm wondering-I'm just wondering this. It makes me curious about whether there's part of that gifted sixth-grade you that knows, knows that if you keep being gifted and you keep being outstanding, eventually someone's going to ask something of you you cannot accomplish, and then you're busted."} 
{"prompt": "No, I don't think it's like that at all.", "completion": "OK, good."} 
{"prompt": "Because it's thinking I can do something that keeps me moving. It's like now, when you just go, hey, OK, I've achieved anonymity. There's nobody around me. My kids are gone, so they're not drawing in adverse attention. And I just have a-you know, it's not a great job, but just, I have a job. And I have good benefits. And I could just disappear in that thing. I could. But there's this thing inside that goes, you want more. You want more. You want more. And I think that's what struggles with that long ago voice that says, and you know if you reach for more, there's going to be penalties. And really, by seventh grade, they're going, you have such a great potential, because you're scoring 99 all the way across on the achievement test. And why aren't you doing better in school? And by then, inside you really are saying, are you kidding? I know better than that. No way am I going to-and just kind of stay down in the middle of the pack. But when life just gets routine and ordinary, boy, this thing comes up, because  you could have more than this. RITA: Nilda tries an explanation that Peggy says no to in this session, which I really liked. I liked how that worked. I could feel Peggy's strength in the relationship, and Nilda rolled with it. It was, yeah, that's fine. JOHN: You know, I think that flows from the existential concept of presence and sort of being present in the room. And Nilda is able to be accepting of Peggy having a different perspective than her, which is a really valuable thing. I also really like the moment in the session where Peggy says, you want more, you want more. Because I think it was exciting and fun, but also it's a preview of what's coming next. RITA: So let's watch for Nilda and Peggy working on some of those existential issues of delight and excitement.", "completion": "Listening to you talk about school-and I understand that when you were with those kids, raising kids, that was feeding you. And now you've moved into a different place because at a certain point, those kids are now going to be doing something different. And they're on their own path."} 
{"prompt": "Pretty much, yeah.", "completion": "Yeah. So here you are, and school is the next leg of your journey, it seems like. That is the leg of the journey you're on. And when I hear you, when I see you, I just sense in you, as you talk about what school means to you, I sense that you are so delighted and so comfortable, and you really have a sense inside you that this is the right thing for you right now."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. I'm like, psyched.", "completion": "Psyched. She's psyched."} 
{"prompt": "Although, you know that thing that says, you really think you can do this? I'm not sure if I can. But semester by semester by semester, I am having a blast.", "completion": "Cool."} 
{"prompt": "I just like, you know, like people go, what? You're taking nine credits this summer? I go, yes. Hot dog. I can't wait. Yeah. Yeah.", "completion": "So here's what I-out of curiosity, I would like you to try this. Just sitting with that delight and excitement that you feel-there's both. There's a delight and an excitement. And just sit with that for a little while and see what you get from that. And maybe if you could, if you would like, just scan your body from head to foot, and don't forget your shoulders and arms. And tell me where do you hold that in your body? Where do you hold that absolute-"} 
{"prompt": "Oh, absolutely right here. Better than cheesecake.", "completion": "The solar pexus. Better than cheesecake."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. Oh, yeah.", "completion": "It's just right there. What does it feel like there?"} 
{"prompt": "It just feels full, like full and satisfying. Like, instead of like, what-what do I need? What do I need?", "completion": "Mmm."} 
{"prompt": "Just go, hot diggigty.", "completion": "Awesome."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. That's good.", "completion": "That's lovely. You don't feel that when you talk about work, but work is-"} 
{"prompt": "Oh gosh. Right.", "completion": "The purpose of work is to support, perhaps."} 
{"prompt": "Well, right. It helps me go to school, and that gives it some meaning.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. And that gives you the meaning. So that-"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. I'm getting other people into school. That's the whole thing. So I'm involved with a lot of people, and that part is good. It's not like, just total bust. But it's a frustrating setup, and it's not very energizing. And there's a lot of-", "completion": "Mmm."} 
{"prompt": "It could be, but the parts that could be seem like they're always getting chopped off at the knees. So.", "completion": "So if when we talk about your experience in school being about delight and excitement, see if you can give me some words for your experience at work."} 
{"prompt": "Hmm. Well, you talked about be taking care of people- that's certainly one thing. It just seems like my coworkers are all kind of falling apart at the seams, for various reasons, and that's it's very important that I just be the person that shows up every day that's reliable and is not having crises, although, you know, I have to run off for this kid or that kid, but not very often anymore. And when I first when, I was crying all the time because of what we' been through with my youngest boy, but now that hardly ever happens. I'm usually just pretty together. I resent it sometimes, because sometimes I just need to not be the person that's holding everything together, but, um, so-", "completion": "So if school is excitement and delight, work is-"} 
{"prompt": "Uh, it's hygiene, I guess. I don't know. It's like-", "completion": "Hygiene."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah. It's like, what-shaving your legs, or something. You have to do it.", "completion": "Yeah."} 
{"prompt": "Actually, that's not a good example, but just something like that that, you know, it's just one of those things. Who likes flossing their teeth, but you just do it. And that's sort of like that.", "completion": "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "So it's not like a complete waste of time, it's got an important function, but just not very fun and don't look forward to it and I don't, I just-I think put on Facebook somebody said, when I die, I'm going to be sorry I didn't spend more time flossing my teeth. Right. It's that kind of thing.", "completion": "Right."} 
{"prompt": "Mm-hmm.", "completion": "So it's not a waste of time."} 
{"prompt": "No, it's not a waste. And it's something worthwhile. I-you know-", "completion": "Like flossing your teeth."} 
{"prompt": "I feel good about what I'm doing. I have good connections with other clerical staff that need me to give them support and to help do some training for them and be there and answer questions, and getting people into school is good. And I have really enjoyable contacts with students. So it's not like the job from hell. It's just that-", "completion": "Does the gifted little girl come into that job at all."} 
{"prompt": "She could.", "completion": "Can you excel, could-"} 
{"prompt": "She could. They could let me write a lot more web pages, and let me have my log in so I don't have to just do everything, give it to somebody else, and hope it turns up sometime in the next three months. And revise the letters so that they really-you know, and they always sort of say, yes, you can do this, but, in reality, it turns out that you can't. So that's frustrating. I mean, there are times when I think, this could be a pretty interesting job, and you could go out and do some training and develop some materials. But the university is-", "completion": "Not giving you that opportunity."} 
{"prompt": "No. No, they're not.", "completion": "So creative is not one of the adjectives you would use to describe this job."} 
{"prompt": "No.", "completion": "And you kind of-"} 
{"prompt": "I like to. Yeah.", "completion": "My feeling is that you really need for things to be very creative in your life. Is that-do you think that's true?"} 
{"prompt": "Yeah, and I like to make solutions. You know, my dad was an engineer. And sometimes I thought if I had known it was going to take me 20 years to get married, I would go back, do that part, and be an engineer of some kind-either an industrial or civil engineering and design things and build things. But I thought at the time I wasn't very good at math, and I thought, I'm going to have kids. That was like, my goal. And I got that goal.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "And, you know, I was telling you before that sometimes I thought, boy, doing that just chopped a hole in the middle of my life, and now I'll never get to do these things I'm really starting to love, because I took 20 years of my life and was out of the workforce. But I'm not sorry I did that. That was what I wanted to do. And I did it, and it pushed me harder than-", "completion": "It was your choice."} 
{"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "You made that very deliberate choice."} 
{"prompt": "If I had birthed those kids, that would have been a different picture-a whole different picture. But as it was, they needed me. I needed them. It was a good symbiotic relationship.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "And I think it's put me on the path to where I am now. I think it's brought things out of me that I didn't know I had-when I didn't feel like a grown-up, when I felt like I have to hide from every scary thing. I could not hide from their scary things because they were my kids.", "completion":""} 
{"prompt": "So that was a different way of approaching life than I had had before. It was like, you can disappear-disappear. You know? I made a pile on all this weight, because that makes you invisible in this culture. And but with my kids, I couldn't afford to disappear, because they needed to have somebody advocate for them. And so they pulled me back to life in a way-I mean, I always thought, I just want a boring, simple life. I would think that. But it wasn't true, and they're the ones  that really just called my bluff. I didn't want life to be boring and simple.", "completion": "Mm-hmm."} 
{"prompt": "I wanted it to be tough and challenging.", "completion": "I'm kind of struck as you talk about that-the word that kind of stayed with me in all of that. Concept's stay with me, but the word that stayed with me through that is this symbiotic, because it seems a really important part of your life. It seems, when I look at these rocks, pretty much it's all-everything you do is kind of symbiotic. Everything is supporting everything in your life."} 
{"prompt": "That's interesting.", "completion": "It's kind of the integrative forces."} 
{"prompt": "So they all just pull together sort of-", "completion": "Doesn't it seem, kinda?"}
